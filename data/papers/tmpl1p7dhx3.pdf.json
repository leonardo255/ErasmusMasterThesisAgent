Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of inter-connected devices that enables communication and sharing of data with one another. It offers effective real-time solutions for both simple and complex systems [1,2]. IoT encompasses a wide array of connected devices equipped with sensors such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, personal digital assistants (PDAs), sensors, actuators, smart mobiles, refrigerators, medical devices and security systems. IoT also includes virtual objects, such as data and virtual desktops in the cloud. Due to its characteristics, IoT appeals to a wide variety of intelligent applications."

Due to its characteristics, IoT appeals to a wide variety of intelligent applications. To address distinct market sectors and use cases, sub-categories of IoT have been created to assist individuals in making more informed decisions, resulting in savings of both money and time [3,4]. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is one of these categories. IIoT is specifically tailored to devices designed for use in industrial settings. Smart Factories and Industry 4.0 leverage IIoT and other computing technologies to enhance automation. The increased utilisation of IIoT and the prevalence of automatic and autonomous behaviour necessitates specific mechanisms for assessing the trustworthiness of data from external sources and identifying misbehaving actors within the system, whether caused by misconfiguration, failure, or malicious intent. In addition, the need to evaluate trust- worthiness when collaborating with other entities is becoming more urgent, especially in dynamic open environments [5–7]. This is accomplished through the development of Trust Management systems. Current trust management systems predominantly rely on physical attributes, in- cluding factors like memory error rates, radio signal strength, number of packets re- ceived/forwarded, repetition rate, delay factors, and energy consumption, to gauge and T echnologies2024, 12, 208. https://doi.org/10.3390/technologies12110208 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/technologies T echnologies2024, 12, 208 2 of 26"

However, relying solely on physical characteristics is insuffi- cient for measuring trustworthiness, especially when these devices become increasingly intelligent and IoT environments become more decentralised, dynamic, and inter-connected. Trust management systems that depend on non-physical parameters have also been es- tablished but they often encounter challenges, such as collecting essential information about the entities, storing information, scoring and ranking, and selecting entities. There is also a need to address how these systems can tackle various IoT challenges, including integrity, heterogeneity, scalability, openness, security, and data storage. Additionally, these systems must also address how to handle misbehaving entities or those delivering inferior or unsatisfactory services. Trust Management systems are important in internet and social computing systems to assess the level of confidence and trustworthiness that should be attributed to other parties before initiating cooperation and interaction [1,7–10]. This enables IoT devices to contact a predefined service provider to determine how, when and with whom to establish connections without jeopardising their objectives.

In this context, the central research question of this study is: “How to select the best service provider in a dynamic smart IoT environment (such as IIoT) based on the trust and reputation of the service provider?”. To address this question, we introduce an IoT agent-based decentralised trust and reputation model known as IoT-CADM (Comprehensive Agent-based Decision-making Model for IoT). This model selects the most trustworthy and dependable service providers for specific services based on multi-context service quality. IoT-CADM collects data from various entities and employs a trust and reputation algorithm to guarantee that service consumers are serviced by the best service providers in the IoT environment, thereby enhancing service consumers’ satisfaction. The trust score is calculated by taking into account the direct experience, the indirect experience and the market value of each agent. The direct and indirect experiences are calculated based on the quality of the service provided (QoS) for the service required and the quality of the service provider (QoP) in providing other services other than the service required. As the objective of this study is to select the best service provider for a particular service, we have included market value in the calculation of the trust score to ensure that only agents with a good track record are selected.

In addition, it also allows new entrants to be considered in the absence of information on direct experience and indirect experience. Our model can also deal with malicious agents. This study employs quantitative research methodology combined with a case study approach. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model against other existing models (ReGreT [11], SIoT [8], and R-D-C [ 12]), we simulated a smart factory based on the SIPOC-Supply-Chain approach (SIPOC stands for suppliers, inputs, process, outputs, and customers.). This smart factory was developed using a multi-agent framework, JADE (JAVA Agent Development Framework). The proposed scenario was intended to mirror the anticipated requirements of agent-based smart factories in the future. We evaluated the models using the multi-criteria decision analysis technique known as TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) [13]. This evaluation was based on a selection of distinct parameters carefully chosen to ensure a fair and equitable comparison. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.

Related Work Trust can be defined as the subjective likelihood that an individual A anticipates another individual B to execute a specific action upon which the well-being of A relies [14]. T echnologies2024, 12, 208 3 of 26 In their definition, ref. [ 14] incorporated the notion of dependence on the trusted party, and the perceived reliability (probability) of the trusted party from the perspective of the trusting party. However, trust can be more complex. For example, having high trust in a person in general is not sufficient to determine whether one should become reliant on that individual in a specific situation. Trust is important in business activities because it forms the foundations for healthy and productive relationships between individuals and organisations. The concept of trust is also introduced in social science to depict a scenario in which a community member called the trustor relies on the actions of another community member known as the trustee [15,16]. On the other hand, reputation often relies on third- party ratings and recommendations.

According to [4,14,15,17], reputation is the perception people hold about someone or something, formed through past experiences following direct or indirect interactions with that entity. Both trust and reputation are used to support data and service management and to boost entities’ collaboration in IoT environments. Trust is represented using a single value with many properties. Ruan and Duressi [18], Yu et al. [7] and Jøsang et al. [14] used the term dimension to denote a number of parameters; separated distrust, time stamp, context-aware and confidence. Firstly, separated distrust (which is the complement of trust) can be used as a representation of trust. A high value of separated distrust represents a high level of trustworthiness, and a low value represents a low level of trustworthiness (untrustworthiness). Secondly, a time stamp is incorporated in the trust value to address the dynamicity of trust. This time stamp can be updated and is used to handle malicious attacks. Thirdly, trust is context-dependent, whereby a trustee may exhibit different trust degrees based on various contexts. Finally, confidence is used to measure the extent to which the trustor is certain about the trust assessment. Trust can be derived from three sources [18–20]: attitude, experience and behaviour. Attitude represents the trustor’s opinion towards the trustee. With experience, the trustor evaluates the trustee’s performance based on previous interactions or transactions with the"

With experience, the trustor evaluates the trustee’s performance based on previous interactions or transactions with the trustee. Trust can also be evaluated based on similarity, social or physical behaviours. Alhandi et al. [21] classified trust models based on trust characteristics, trust archi- tecture, trust distribution, trust aggregation technique, trust model type and attack type. Two types of trust attributes can be found in IoT environments: non-social trust and QoS and social trust. Non-social trust deals with high quality services in response to service requests and social trust deals with the owners of the IoT devices. Trust architecture can be centralised, distributed or decentralised, while trust distribution can be direct, indirect and hybrid. Hybrid is the most common source of trust and combines direct trust and indirect trust. Trust Management Systems (TMSs) play an important role on the Internet and social computing systems. Applications are designed to help users make better decisions based on trust information. TMSs can be divided into three parts [1,7,18,22]. Firstly, trust modelling deals with how to represent trust relationships in computational models. Secondly, trust management describes how to collect evidence and perform risk evaluation. Finally, decision making allows TMSs to work more intelligently and efficiently.

To date, research on data sensitivity and privacy has primarily concentrated on as- sessing trustworthiness with the aim of optimising satisfaction and performance in IoT applications, particularly those involving decision-making and partner-selection [5–7,23]. In addition, work on trust management has focused on distributed wireless networks [24], applications of trust techniques in IoT domains, including the use of an intelligent agent [25], as well as wireless sensor networks and RFIDs [21]. The literature on trust and reputation models can be broadly categorised into three types: trust and reputation in IoT, trust and T echnologies2024, 12, 208 4 of 26 reputation in a Multi-Agent System (MAS) and the combination of IoT and agent-based trust and reputation. 2.1.

Firstly, it enhances the satisfaction and performance of IoT applications. Secondly, it is crucial to maintain effective collaboration among the nodes deployed within the network and to guarantee trustworthy operation of these nodes [5–7]. The rationale for providing a trust management system for IoT systems is to safeguard against misbehaving devices (or owners) conducting discriminatory attacks and to ensure that the IoT ecosystem remains secure and fair [1,4,12,26]. In Public Reputation Systems (PRSs), users rate each other to establish trust by means of reputation. This kind of reputation system relies on a central unit (server), which collects and consolidates all feedback following each event. Four models based on a centralised model have been proposed. These are IoTrust [27], HAMS (Health/Accessibility Monitoring Service) [23], IoT-TM (IoT-Trust Management) [5], and Hierarchical Zones [1]. IoTrust is a centralised trust architecture comprising of five layers: the nodes layer, software defined network layer, the organization layer, and the reputation management layer [27]. The goal of the model is to identify reliable and trustworthy partners.

This is intended to prevent a malicious node (or organisation) from gaining access to the tags in the objects layer and potentially initiating various attacks that could severely damage the network. In a similar context, Shayesteh et al. introduced the HAMS model [23]. HAMS serves as a centralised service that gathers real-time observations from peers, assesses their contributions and calculates trust scores for users (entities) using Bayesian learning-based procedure. IoT-TM is a cluster- based approach designed to tackle IoT trust management issues, including countering bad-mouthing attacks and memory-efficient trust computation [ 5]. The architecture of IoT-TM comprises cluster nodes, master nodes, clusters and a super node. These IoT nodes are organised into clusters according to their trustworthiness. The trust values of these nodes may fluctuate (rise or fall) depending on the interactions with others within the same cluster. A hierarchical network concept for intrusion detection by partitioning IoT nodes into distinct zones or clusters was introduced by [1]. The trusted base station manages these zones, ensures the security of data transmission, and identifies and removes any malicious nodes that are attempting to spy on others. Each node must evaluate the trustworthiness of a peer node that wishes to communicate with it based on physical network parameters, such as received radio power, noise, and number of received packets."

Utilising a centralised reputation system like PRS carries inherent risks which may result in single points of failure. These include physical and logical network failures and security attacks. To mitigate these risks, a range of decentralised trust and reputation systems and mechanisms have been developed. A smart trust management method was introduced by [3] to diminish the influence of On–Off attackers. Using machine learning and an adaptable sliding window technique, this model evaluates the trustworthiness of IoT resources by categorising the data into classes and flexibly adjusting the window size according to these classes. Only values that are within the presumed trust range (values between the lower and upper bounds of the elastic sliding window) are acceptable. Other- wise, out-of-range values are considered as outliers. The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is a trust management scheme [8]. SIoT operates within an edge computing environment, which requires each active node (person) to use a handheld device (mini-edge servers) to handle traffic forwarding and computational functions. SIoT calculates the trustworthiness of any entity keen to collaborate with its peers. The trust score is calculated by adding the T echnologies2024, 12, 208 5 of 26 scores for direct observations, indirect recommendations, centrality, energy and service."

Since all devices in SIoT are low-powered and use less energy, energy consumption is used to identify if a node is involved in an attack. An innovative three values (3v) trust model was introduced by [ 28] for IoT-ad hoc systems with the purpose of mitigating the presence of misbehaving entities within IoT-ad hoc network-based applications. The model uses a novel logic called 3v-TCTLC to reason about commitments in uncertain environments regarding trust. The proposed model was validated using smart health monitoring and smart home systems. Recent research on trust management in IoT systems includes an adaptive trust model based on recommendation filtering algorithms for IoT systems [29], tackling the uncertainty of trust by introducing a new trust method using behavioural similarity between sensor nodes [30], and the development of a hybrid trust management approach using Probabilistic Neighbourhood Overlap in combination with a mix of a dynamic and static approach [31].

T rust and Reputation in MAS Trust and reputation mechanisms are one of the key elements in designing multi-agent systems (MASs). In distributed environments, agents have no prior information about the behaviour of their potential partners. As such, these agents have no choice but to rely on trust and reputation mechanisms to assess this behaviour. In this context, trust and reputation mechanisms are employed to manage interactions among the agents and to safeguard good agents from fraudulent ones [45]. Marsh, in 1994 [46], presented a formalism approach for a trust and reputation mech- anism in MAS. The proposed mechanism can be employed by an agent to determine whether it is advantageous to collaborate with another agent by relying on their prior direct interactions. This model describes three types of trust: basic trust, general trust, and situational trust. Basic trust is the general disposition to trust irrespective of who is the agent in question and is calculated from past experiences for all situations. General trust represents the general trust between the agent (x) and another agent (y) without reference to any particular situation. Situational trust is used to compute the degree of trust that one agent holds for another agent in a specific situation. In this model, the trust value ranges from −1 to + 1, where −1 denotes a negative trust (distrust), 0 indicates no trust, and +1 signals a strong positive trust."

Context-aware Bernoulli Neural Network-based Reputation Assessment (COBRA) [47] is a framework that accurately predicts the trustworthiness of a target agent. In this model, an agent attempts to predict the conditional probability p to determine the trustworthiness of the other agent for a given context. This approach does not make any assumptions about the presence of stereotypical or socio-cognitive information. In MAS, computational trust and reputation models have traditionally considered two types of information sources: the direct interactions among agents, and information provided by society members about their past experiences. The Comprehensive Reputation Model (CRM) [17] is a probabilistic-based reputation model with the goal of securing multi-agent systems by mitigating the influence of self-interested agents. In the online evaluation, agents assess the trustworthiness of other relatively unknown agents by collecting relevant information. This data is collected from their own previous direct interactions or other trustworthy agents, who can offer recommendations in the form of ratings (indirect interactions). In the offline evaluation, the trustor agents are expected to update the consulting agents with their information about the trustee agent after a variable period of direct interactions.

Disrepute describes negative opinions, while conflict captures the consistency of the agent behaviours. Reputation represents positive opinions and is used to improve the selection process for a trustworthy provider in a multi-agent system. In this model, the agent calculates the R-D-C value for each provider and picks the most trustworthy provider using a decision matrix. The ReGreT system [11] uses social relations as a third source of information, apart from the information obtained from direct and indirect interactions. ReGreT bolsters the agent’s abilities to handle trust and reputation. The main goal is to enhance the agent’s performance in a complex e-commerce environment and assist consumers in making rational decisions.

A new generation of IoT devices have the potential to work autonomously, make rational decisions and negotiate with other IoT devices to achieve a specific goal. In this environment, IoT applications will have the ability to solve complex problems and, in turn, maximise their performance. Trustworthy Agent Execution Chip (TAEC) is an autonomic-agent-trust model for IoT systems [ 48], implemented on a physical chip to improve security in dynamic IoT environments. The Trustable Agent comprises the task entity, the attributes and a security and reliability protection module. These agents are embedded in the sensor nodes and it is assumed that each sensor node must install a TAEC. These agents run in containers, which are managed by agencies. Agencies provide services, such as communication, registration, management, migration, persistence and security and reliability protection. In a similar work, a centralised Trust Management System (TMS) manages security procedures by monitoring previous interactions in the network to identify malicious attacks and self-serving behaviour in the context of IoT [ 9].

Privacy-preserving and reputation in the distributed Machine-to-Machine (M2M-REP) environment was proposed by [49]. M2M-REP detects infected and malicious machines that compromise the network integrity. The presence of these malicious machines reduces data security and increases financial losses. M2M-REP evaluates the global reputation scores for any machine by aggregating the direct trust scores from other machines it interacted with. This process is carried out using a directed weighted graph, which represents the human–machine or machine–machine network.

On the other hand, existing trust management systems, which rely on non- physical parameters, have not fully considered how information about entities can be collected, stored, scored and ranked.

Moreover, it is a valuable indicator of how investors perceive a company business prospects. which can lead to a reduction in investment risks. This is because the dynamic nature of market value is dependent on many factors, such as physical operating conditions, economic conditions and the supply and demand. IoT- CADM leverages this point to gauge the performance indicators of the suppliers (companies or investors). This can reduce the selection risk and provide more opportunities for new service providers to be selected. For all equations, the parameter STime is used to indicate the time effect, where recent transactions are more important than older ones.

Taken together, in this evaluation mechanism, aSC selects the most trustworthy aSP (the one with the highest trust score) to provide the service. 3.2. The Auto-Scale Weights (ASW) IoT-TESM is an evaluation technique to assess the trustworthiness of the IoT-CADM environments’ members, by combining the information collected from direct experience (DtSPi), indirect experience (IndtSPi), and market evaluation (MrkVal), as discussed earlier. Based on Equation (1), the values of the weights α, β and γ need to be set correctly and carefully. In this model, there are two ways to set these values: by giving the owner the ability to adjust them manually or by using the proposed ASW technique.

We chose these models for comparison as they are similar to our proposed model and the calculation of the trust score is primarily based on direct and indirect experience. In addition, ReGreT and R-D-C are both agent-based trust and reputation models and SIoT is a trust and reputation model for IoT. There is no comparable model for a combination of agent-based and IoT trust and reputation. 4.1. Experimental Setup IoT-CADM was developed and implemented using the JADE framework. In this environment, the following steps are performed: (1) detects new service, (2) collects information, (3) calculates the trust and reputation score, (4) selects service provider, and (5) finalises the contract agreement with the selected provider. This sequence of steps is defined as a transaction, which can be completed in one simulation tick. Each time tick is equal to 6 h. To replicate the real-world, we run the simulation for 10,000 time ticks, which is equivalent to seven years. By setting this to 10,000 time ticks, we allow ample time for the selection process to be repeated many times and the databases to be populated with historical data.

A waiting time is set before repeating the reordering process. The waiting time can be set to a constant value (Xct) or by multiplying the ReO value by Xct. In this experiment, we assume that the environment is populated with varying number of honest and dishonest agents. Dishonest agents (or attackers) are generated randomly. These dishonest agents are assumed to use bad-mouthing and/or on–off attacks. In a bad-mouthing attack, a dishonest agent can ruin the trust level of honest agents by giving them bad recommendations. Consequently, their reputation is negatively affected and the chance of these honest agents being selected for service is reduced. With the on– off attack, dishonest agents can randomly perform a trustworthy service to hide their untrustworthy behaviour. The values for the multi-context QoS and QoP (shown in Table 1) are randomised based on normal distribution and bounded between 0 and 100 to simulate the service providers’ overall performance in the provision of a specific service.

In a real-world setting, it is expected that this data will need to be collected qualitatively and then converted to numeric values. For example, for a given Service X, Agent A has the following values: 80, 70, 70, 90, 80, 80, 80, while Agent B has the following values: 50, 60, 60, 70, 70, 60, 50. Based on these QoS parameters, it can be said that Agent A offers a better service for service X as it offers a better lead time and the service offered is more similar to Service X. Its description of the service is also more similar to Service X when compared to that of Agent B. In addition, Agent A offers a better service guarantee, service satisfaction, service cost, and over request. We have simplified this in our model so that we can focus on the trust evaluation and the selection of agents. We assume that the service consumer agent has access to these parameters. There are five sets of agents’ distributions in this environment: 70, 110, 150, 190, and 230 agents. In addition, a different percentage (0%, 25%,50%, and 75%) of dishonest agents was used in different scenarios. We decided to limit the percentage of dishonest agent to 75% as, in the real world, it would be uncommon to have more than 75% dishonest agents in the environment.

These distributions adhere to the supply chain concept, as previously discussed, with the first level (L1) representing the final service consumer, and the fourth level (L4) corresponding to the raw material providers. Between L1 and L4, agents in L2 and L3 both consume services from the lower level and offer services to the higher level.

IoT-CADM has the highest trust scores for all scenarios when compared to the other models. It can be seen that, during the first quarter, ReGreT recorded the lowest trust scores. In contrast, SIoT and R-D-C recorded higher scores, as both models used physical information to avoid random selection. However, at time tick 5000, ReGreT outperformed SIoT and R-D-C, signalling the importance of incorporating social information within the environment after a certain period of time. By leveraging on the social information and employing the dynamic ASW method (with appropriately scaled weights), IoT-CADM maintains consistent performance at all times across all scenarios. We also computed the PDS (percentage of difference and superiority) for all models. PDS calculates the percentage of difference between two values to determine how close they are relative to the larger value. Based on these calculated values, IoT-CADM surpassed ReGreT by 38%, SIoT by 40%, and R-D-C by 41% in selecting the most trustworthy aSP .

It can be seen that the proposed model gained more cash than the other models for all scenarios. In the first sub-scenario (SSR1.1), the total cash gained by all the models is much lower compared to SSR1.2–SSR1.5. It should be noted that the number of agents in SSR1.1 is 70 and this number is gradually increased to 110 in SSR1.2 and eventually to 230 in SSR1.5 (see Table 3). This means that, as the number of agents in the environment increases, there are more service requests which, in turn results in more business transactions. An increase in the number of successful transactions leads to an increase in monetary gain. R-D-C recorded the lowest profit at the beginning of the simulation but eventually converged to a value similar to those of the ReGreT and SIoT models after time tick 2000. The performance of the three models (ReGreT, R-D-C and SIoT) is very similar across all scenarios. Even though the cash gained by the three models increased over time for all scenarios, their total cash gained is much lower than that for IoT-CADM. In more detail, Figure 8 shows the total cash gained by each model, with IoT-CADM delivering the highest total cash gained to service consumers, followed by ReGreT, SIoT and R-D-C.

Table 4 shows that IoT-CADM achieves the highest performance when all the agents in the environment are honest. This is followed by SIoT, ReGreT and R-D-C. Furthermore, IoT-CADM also recorded the highest performance even when the weight (pw) for each parameter was altered. This suggests that IoT-CADM demonstrates more stability and adaptability for use in diverse environments and scenarios.

Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we described IoT-CADM, a trust and reputation model that can be used to select the best service provider in an IoT environment. IoT-CADM uses IoT-TESM to evaluate each service provider. IoT-TESM calculates the trust score of a service provider agent by considering its direct experience, indirect experience and market evaluation. Multi- context QoS and QoP are used in evaluating both direct experience and indirect experience."

The inclusion of multi-context QoP provides more opportunities for new service providers to be considered and decreases the effect of negative ratings and fake ratings. Our approach differs from other existing works in two ways. Firstly, we consider multi-context QoS and QoP in evaluating direct and indirect experiences. Secondly, we included market valuation in the calculation of the trust score to solve the cold start problem, where none of the agents have complete information at the beginning of the simulation. We demonstrated the superiority of our model against three existing models, ReGreT, R-D-C and SIoT, where IoT-CADM outperformed all three models in both performance measures for trustworthiness and cash utility in honest and dishonest environments. In addition, the TOPSIS technique was used to rank the competing models, and our model achieved the highest ranking. Our work advances the state of the art by providing a multi- agent framework than can be used evaluate the trust and reputation of service providers in an IoT setting capitalising on IoT-TESM, which uses multi-context QoS in evaluating direct experience and indirect experience and market evaluation.

      "text": "There are several limitations to our work. In our simulation, we have randomised the values of all the QoS parameters. It would have been advantageous to implement various methods to convert qualitative data to quantitative data. We did not implement this, as the focus of this work is on the trust score evaluation and selection of agents. We also assumed that the referees, trusted friends and neighbour agents are willing share the information of a given service provider. We acknowledge that in the real-world, some parties may be unwilling to share this information due to privacy issues. The QoS parameters are also available to all the service consumer agents. Even though our model can detect malicious agents, it does not penalise these malicious agents. Honest agents are also not rewarded. As IoT-CADM is a flexible framework, these limitations can be addressed in future work building on the current implementation. A further extension of this work would be to examine the impact of unsecured network connection on trust and reputation. In this study, it was assumed that the agents are transacting in a fully secured environment. It would be interesting to investigate the performance of our model in an unsecured environment. We are also keen to implement the proposed models in other smart environments with the aim of developing a universal trust and reputation model that can be applied in any IoT settings.
