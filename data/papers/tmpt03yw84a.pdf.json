The greatest differences emerged when ranking systems were introduced. Additionally, the AI itself was not the decisive factor. What mattered most was digital literacy, users with stronger digital skills were more likely to trust AI, while others relied more on community input. We also observed clear gaps between experts, who tended to be more critical, and customers, who were more open but cautious. Furthermore, AI alone is not enough. Consumer conﬁdence is built where technology meets human connection and digital literacy. The future is not AI versus people, but AI with people. Economy, Business and Artiﬁcial Intelligence Arjan Kadareja Adviser to the President of the Republic of Albania Artiﬁcial intelligence offers a tremendous opportunity. If properly harnessed, it can drive higher economic growth and lower unemployment. Businesses become more efﬁ- cient, new business models emerge, and the economy can beneﬁt from innovation at an unprecedented scale. However, early signs of market concentration and AI power in the hands of a few large ﬁrms remind us that AI cannot be left to evolve on its own. Without guidance, it risks creating inequality and stiﬂing competition. This is where public policy comes in.

Governments can shape AI’s impact by reforming business models, updating the tax code, amplifying labor voices, and funding research that complements human capabilities rather than replaces them. By combining strategic policies with responsi- ble AI adoption, we can ensure that technology strengthens both business and society, unlocking growth while keeping the economy fair and inclusive. Enabling Startups in the AI and Digital Space – New Business Models, Stronger Support and a Caring Environment R. Ian Angell Managing Director of Embark Startups are the engines of AI and digital innovation. To thrive, they need new business models, strong support, and a caring environment. But success starts with a focus on founders their vision, challenges, and growth. Mentorship and advisory support are never enough, and founders often face unique hurdles when working with student interns. Y et these interns are key stakeholders, bringing fresh perspectives and energy. At the same time, startups need diverse expertise in AI, and connections with government and industry partners can make a real difference. By nurturing founders, providing guidance, leveraging talent, and building strong ecosystems, we can help AI and digital startups transform ideas into real-world impact.

Cancer is one of the most common diseases worldwide. The develop- ment of early and accurate diagnosis methods for cancer is of great importance to people. Extraction of radiomic features, which involves extracting numerical features from imaging-based data, is one method that can be useful for cancer detection and treatment. In this study, classiﬁcation was performed on multi-class cancer types using radiomic features that are extracted from medical images. Dif- ferent machine-learning algorithms were employed in the classiﬁcation process, and their hyperparameters were optimized using the Optuna library.

Since these techniques rely on visual interpretation by experts, they are susceptible to differences in interpretation and subjective assessments. Radiomics provides numerical values of disease by automatically extracting quantitative features, such as texture, shape, intensity, and wavelet, from medical images and correlating these features with disease biology. Tumor heterogeneity is more accurately represented by detecting microstructural changes that are not visually noticeable with radiomics analy- sis [ 5]. Thus, indirect inferences can be made based on numerical data of diseases using radiomics data. In addition, by utilizing radiomics features, treatment strategies tailored to individual patients can be developed, and diseases can be diagnosed early before clinical symptoms appear. With these advantages, radiomics has become an important part of prognostic and predictive modeling, showing that medical imaging is not only a tool for diagnosis [ 6]. Numerous studies in the literature demonstrate that radiomic features can be effec- tively combined with machine learning algorithms to classify cancer types, stages, and biological subtypes with high accuracy. Radiomic features are numerical and high-dimensional statistical descriptors derived from medical images. This data is one-dimensional (1D) and is in a format suitable for"

This data is one-dimensional (1D) and is in a format suitable for use directly in machine learning algorithms. In this respect, radiomics-based classiﬁ- cation approaches offer a much more efﬁcient structure compared to 2D or 3D image- based analysis methods. Especially in 2D/3D-based deep learning applications, there are limitations, including high computational costs, long training times, and large data requirements due to the dense pixel information. In the classiﬁcation performed using radiomic data, the resulting data are in a compact, meaningful, and computationally convenient form. This situation not only increases the classiﬁcation accuracy but also makes the model more explainable and clinically interpretable. The primary objective of this study is to identify the key radiomic features that signiﬁcantly contribute to the classiﬁcation performance in lung cancer and to develop an effective and interpretable classiﬁcation method that can distinguish between different types of lung cancer by processing these features in a one-dimensional structure. Medical imaging data, such as CT and PET scans, are typically recorded in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format. To reduce processing time and increase system compatibility, the traditional DICOM format was converted to PNG format, a lighter and more practical alternative, and radiomic features were extracted"

The study’s ﬁndings reveal that the choice of classiﬁer is a determinant of performance in radiomics- based predictions, demonstrating that these methods can be applied more widely in precision oncology applications. Another study in the ﬁeld [ 8] demonstrated that computer-aided radiomic analysis can be predictive in the molecular classiﬁcation of breast cancer subtypes. Tumor pheno- types extracted from MR images of 91 invasive breast cancer patients in the TCGA/TCIA database were seen to be signiﬁcantly associated with hormone receptor status and molecular subtypes. The model achieved a high classiﬁcation accuracy with an AUC of 0.89. These results suggest that radiomics-based image analysis may be a promis- ing biomarker that enhances the applicability of precision medicine by distinguishing subtypes in breast cancer. Radiomics studies related to the lung are also discussed. In a study in the ﬁeld [ 9], tumor phenotype was quantitatively analyzed using 440 radiomics features obtained from CT images of 1,019 patients with lung and head/neck cancer. The results suggest that certain features are prognostically signiﬁcant.

The 3D CNN model trained on CT images obtained from seven in-dependent datasets signiﬁcantly predicted two-year survival in patients undergoing radiotherapy (AUC = 0.70) and surgery (AUC = 0.71). The CNN model performed random forest models based on classical clinical variables. Deep learning may hold promise in determining survival risks from CT images in patients with NSCLC. Another study [ 11] evaluated the relationship between semi- quantitative and radiomic features obtained from 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging performed before immunotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and their treatment response and survival prediction. In radiomics analysis, features such as high volume and tumor heterogeneity, which reﬂect “skewness” and “kurtosis,” were associated with failure in immunotherapy. It was also predicted that the M stage (metastatic spread) would be sig- niﬁcantly associated with progression-free survival and overall survival. These ﬁndings suggest that PET/CT-based radiomics features may be strong prognostic biomarkers in NSCLC patients who are candidates for immunotherapy. In [12], a prediction model was created by combining CT-based radiomics features and serum tumor markers (STM) to classify NSCLC subtypes.

These datasets are signiﬁcant for understanding can- cer structure, classifying diseases, and developing personalized treatments. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) [ 16] and the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) are among the lead- ing data providers in this ﬁeld [ 17]. While the NCI incorporates genomic, clinical, and epidemiological data to support national-level oncological research, TCIA provides a digital archive that offers open access to researchers, particularly radiological image data. The data sets in TCIA include advanced imaging methods such as CT, MR, and PET, which are integrated with clinical and genetic information.

The hyperparameters of these models were optimized with the Optuna library, thus increasing the overall success rate and general- izability of the models. Optuna adopts the Bayesian optimization approach, a modern hyperparameter search strategy, and utilizes the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm [ 20]. Optuna determines the most appropriate parameter combination that achieves maxi-mum model performance by efﬁciently scanning the parameter space. This study deﬁned various hyperparameters, including learning rate, maximum depth, number of estimators, and subsample, for each model. The number of trials was kept within certain limits (Table 1).

In the study, three machine learning algorithms were preferred for classiﬁcation: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. The best hyperparameters obtained from hyperparameter optimization with Optuna are given in Table 3. The success values of the models are given in Table 4. In the tables, class 0 is represented as adenocarcinoma, class 1 as small cell carcinoma, and class 2 as large cell carcinoma. XGBoost was the model that gave the highest overall success among all classes. The accuracy value of the model is 87%, which is the highest compared to other models. The recall value of 0.92 obtained for class 1,in particular, indicates that the samples belonging to this class are primarily predicted correctly. The F1-score values of classes 0 and 2 are also quite balanced, with 0.86 and 0.85, respectively.

XAI aims to eliminate this uncertainty, interpret the decision mechanisms of models, and make them transparent. XAI can be particularly crucial when making high-risk decisions. Additionally, XAI enhances user conﬁdence, improves compliance, and offers developers debugging oppor- tunities throughout the model development process. In particular, methods such as SHAP and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) provide users with more control and insight by explaining the reasons behind individual predictions.

Through these analyses, visually unno- ticeable patterns in images are revealed through mathematical features, enabling the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up processes of diseases to be determined. However, increasing the clinical signiﬁcance of these features is directly related to the data acqui- sition processes and the success of the artiﬁcial intelligence methods used in classifying these data. Using radiomics analysis in image-based medical classiﬁcation applications has advantages over traditional deep learning-based direct image processing approaches. Radiomics analysis allows the numerical modeling of statistical, morphological, and textural features extracted from medical images. This structure reduces high-dimensional and complex image data to a more compact and processable form, simplifying the model training process and enabling efﬁcient use of computational resources. Deep convolutional neural networks are often preferred in classiﬁcation approaches that utilize high-resolution images, such as CT and PET scans, directly. Such models Explainable Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Hyperparameter-Optimized Machine 15 require signiﬁcant computational power during training due to the high number of lay- ers and parameters.

In contrast, machine learning models working with radiomics data can be trained in signiﬁcantly shorter times and imple- mented with lower hardware costs, as they have fewer parameters to optimize. This reduction in training time yields signiﬁcant gains in both time and cost, particularly for large datasets. An important advantage of radiomics-based models, particularly in terms of model complexity, is that they can achieve high classiﬁcation accuracy with structures at a lower depth. This feature directly increases the explainability of the model and facilitates clinical interpretation, mainly when supported by methods such as SHAP . Deep learning models that directly use images are generally black-box in nature, as the points made in the background and the focus are unknown, and their use in the health ﬁeld may be limited in terms of clinical reliability. In this study, SHAP anal- yses reveal that the model provides high accuracy and bases its decisions on clini- cally meaningful radiomic features. Especially the prominence of variables such as ﬁrstorder_10Percentile, glrlm_LowGrayLevelRunEmphasis, and glcm_MCC show that the model captures the distinctive microstructural and textural features of malignant tis- sues.

In this study, three different machine learning algorithms were evaluated compar- atively and showed remarkable results regarding their classiﬁcation performances on radiomic data. The XGBoost model was the most successful, achieving an 87% accu- racy rate and F1-score values across all classes. This result demonstrates that the model possesses high discrimination power and can effectively handle complex radiomic struc- tures. LightGBM has also produced successful results, and the high recall value, espe- cially in class 1, reveals that the model is strong in distinguishing certain pathological patterns. The CatBoost model also stands out with lower discrimination between classes, achieving an accuracy rate of 80% and an insufﬁcient recall rate, especially in class 0. These values highlight the model’s sensitivity and its dependence on the data struc- ture.The high success rates achieved by XGBoost and LightGBM models suggest that these models can be effectively utilized in medical decision support systems.

On Deﬁning a Framework for Responsible and Ethical AI in Digital 33 3.3 General Key Challenges 3.3.1 Data Privacy Concerns Data privacy remains a signiﬁcant barrier to ethical AI. Large-scale AI models require vast datasets, often containing sensitive personal information. Breaches, such as the 2021 Cambridge Analytica scandal, underscore the risks of misuse. Compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA is complex, particularly for cross-border data ﬂows. A 2024 survey found that 60% of organizations struggle to anonymize data effectively, increasing vulnerability to privacy violations [ 21]. 3.3.2 Cultural Variability in Ethical Standards Ethical standards vary across cultures, complicating global AI frameworks.

For example, attitudes toward AI in surveillance differ between Western democracies, which prioritize individual privacy, and authoritarian regimes, which emphasize state security. A 2023 study on AI ethics in Asia-Paciﬁc revealed divergent priorities, with Japan focusing on trust and China on efﬁciency [ 22]. Harmonizing these perspectives requires inclusive dia- logue, yet only 30% of AI governance frameworks incorporate non-Western viewpoints [ 23]. 3.3.3 Unintended Consequences of Autonomous Systems Autonomous AI systems pose risks of unintended consequences. For instance, algo- rithmic trading systems caused the 2010 Flash Crash, wiping $1 trillion from markets in minutes. In healthcare, overreliance on AI diagnostics led to misdiagnoses in 15% of cases in a 2022 study, particularly in under-resourced settings [ 24]. These incidents highlight the need for human oversight and robust testing to mitigate risks. 3.3.4 Environmental Impact The environmental footprint of AI is a growing concern. Training large models like GPT-4 emits carbon equivalent to 300 transatlantic ﬂights [ 25]. Data centers powering AI consume 2% of global electricity, projected to rise to 5% by 2030.

On Deﬁning a Framework for Responsible and Ethical AI in Digital 37 3.5 A Preliminary Analysis of Bias in Ethical AI Frameworks What is Bias in AI?  Bias in AI refers to systematic errors or prejudices in AI systems that lead to unfair, inaccurate, or discriminatory outcomes. These biases can manifest in data, algo- rithms, or human-AI interactions, often reﬂecting societal inequalities or ﬂawed design choices. Bias undermines the fairness, reliability, and trustworthiness of AI systems, making it a critical issue for ethical AI frameworks.  Types of Bias: – Data Bias: Arises from unrepresentative or skewed datasets. Example: A facial recognition system trained on predominantly light-skinned faces may misidentify darker-skinned individuals, as seen in early versions of commercial facial recognition tools (e.g., IBM Watson, 2018). – Algorithmic Bias: Results from model design or optimization prioritizing certain outcomes. Example: A hiring algorithm favoring male candidates due to historical hiring patterns (e.g., Amazon’s scrapped AI tool, 2018). – Interaction Bias: Occurs when user interactions reinforce biased outcomes. Example: Social media algorithms amplifying polarizing content based on user engagement."

A preliminary view on the prevalence of Bias sources in AI Systems according to the state-of-the-art literature and case studies ﬁndings mentioned in this study Importance Of Bias for Ethical AI Frameworks  Addressing bias is a cornerstone of ethical AI frameworks like FRE-AIDT, AI4People, and OECD AI Principles because it directly impacts fairness, account- ability, and societal trust, which are central to responsible AI. Below, I outline On Deﬁning a Framework for Responsible and Ethical AI in Digital 39 why bias mitigation is critical, with connections to the frameworks’ principles and implementation strategies.  Ensuring Fairness and Equity: – Why It Matters: Bias leads to unequal treatment, violating ethical principles of justice and non-discrimination. Fairness ensures AI outcomes beneﬁt all demographics equitably. – FRE-AIDT: The Fairness pillar mandates bias mitigation through fairness-aware algorithms (e.g., IBM’s AI Fairness 360) and regular audits using metrics like demographic parity.

Facial recognition technology is widely used for authentication and security purposes; however, its vulnerability to spooﬁng attacks presents signiﬁ- cant risks. Spooﬁng techniques such as printed photographs, digital screen replays, and 3D masks can deceive recognition systems. This study addresses these vul- nerabilities by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to differentiate between genuine and spoofed facial images. Using established datasets such as CelebA-Spoof and CASIA-FASD, along with widely adopted tools like OpenCV and TensorFlow, we develop and evaluate a model designed to enhance facial recognition security. The proposed model emphasizes robust liveness detection to ensure accurate biometric authentication and reduce the risk of identity fraud. Experimental results demonstrate high classiﬁcation accuracy, underscoring the potential of CNN-based approaches to improve the reliability of facial recognition systems in real-world scenarios."

Moreover, integrating local texture and depth information has shown promise in improving detec- tion robustness. A method proposed by researchers in 2024 utilized Swin-Transformer to jointly model local textures and constructed depth, resulting in enhanced performance across various datasets. Additionally, the Heterogeneous Auto-Similarities of Character- istics (HASC) descriptor has been introduced to capture intricate feature dependencies, offering competitive results in face spooﬁng detection [ 2]. Comprehensive surveys have also highlighted the evolution of FAS methods. A 2024 survey by Huang et al. categorized deep learning-based FAS approaches into two- class and one-class methods, discussing techniques like auxiliary supervision, meta- learning, and adversarial learning. Another extensive review emphasized the need for generalization in FAS models, especially with the emergence of transformer-based and generative methods [ 3, 4].

However, the widespread adoption of facial recognition systems has been met with increasing con- cerns over their vulnerability to spooﬁng attacks. These attacks exploit the system by pre- senting falsiﬁed facial representations—such as photographs, videos, or 3D masks—to impersonate genuine users and bypass security checks [ 6]. The growing sophistication of spooﬁng techniques has intensiﬁed the need for intel- ligent and resilient anti-spooﬁng systems. Traditional countermeasures, such as tex- ture analysis or motion-based veriﬁcation (e.g., blink detection), are often insufﬁcient against high-ﬁdelity forgeries. Deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Net- works (CNNs), has emerged as a powerful alternative for spoof detection by automat- ically learning discriminative features directly from facial images [ 5, 6]. CNNs have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing subtle differences between real and spoofed faces, even under challenging lighting or occlusion conditions. Beyond authentication, CNN-based facial analysis systems have shown promising results in other security-critical and socially impactful contexts. For example, in exam supervision, deep learning models such as Faster RCNN and MTCNN have been suc- cessfully used to detect suspicious behaviors like head movements and to recognize students’ faces during live examinations, achieving accuracy rates over 98% [ 7].

These applications reinforce the broader relevance of facial image understanding beyond spoof detection alone. 48 A. Alkholid et al. The main contributions may be summarized as follows:  We propose a robust CNN-based model trained on publicly available RGB facial datasets—CelebA-Spoof and CASIA-FASD—for detecting presentation attacks including print, replay, and 3D mask spoofs. The model achieves approximately 97% classiﬁcation accuracy, demonstrating competitive performance against state- of-the-art benchmarks.  The model architecture leverages standard deep learning components (convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, and softmax classiﬁcation), optimized using the Adam opti- mizer and trained with data augmentation techniques to enhance generalization and robustness.  To improve accessibility and usability, we develop a real-time web application using TensorFlow.js, OpenCV .js, and React, enabling live spoof detection using a webcam feed within the browser environment.

In recent years, deep learning approaches particularly Convolutional Neural Net- works (CNNs)—have become the dominant paradigm due to their capacity to learn hierarchical features directly from raw pixel data [ 12]. CNNs can autonomously extract discriminative spatial features, leading to improved generalization across spooﬁng sce- narios [13]. For example, architectures inspired by VGG or ResNet have shown remark- able performance when applied to anti-spooﬁng tasks, especially when trained on large annotated datasets. Facial Spoof Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques 49 A key advancement in the ﬁeld is the development of two-stream CNNs that operate on complementary image representations. Chen et al. [ 4–16] proposed an attention- based two-stream network that processes both RGB and multi-scale retinex (MSR) inputs. While the RGB stream retains rich texture information, it is sensitive to lighting variations. In contrast, the MSR stream offers illumination-invariant representations. The proposed architecture employs an attention mechanism to fuse both streams effectively, demonstrating strong performance across benchmark datasets such as CASIA-FASD and REPLA Y -A TTACK.

These results highlight the beneﬁt of leveraging complementary image modalities to improve resilience against illumination-based spooﬁng artifacts. Other studies have adopted feature engineering approaches that analyse image dis- tortions as cues for liveness detection. Wen et al. [ 8] introduced a technique called Image Distortion Analysis (IDA), where features like specular reﬂection, blurriness, chromatic moments, and colour diversity are extracted to detect spoof attempts. An ensemble of SVM classiﬁers is used to learn the attack-speciﬁc patterns across different spooﬁng types. Their multiform voting-based scheme for video spoof detection demon- strated competitive results on the CASIA-FASD, Idiap REPLA Y -A TTACK, and MSU MFSD databases, underscoring the complexity of distinguishing real from fake faces in cross-device and cross-dataset settings. To further enhance detection accuracy, some research efforts have incorporated tem- poral information from video-based attacks by integrating CNNs with recurrent lay- ers such as LSTMs [ 12]. Others have explored the use of multi-modal inputs, such as depth or infrared data, to improve discrimination power [13].

While cross-database evaluations remain a challenge due to domain shift, models that combine architectural innovations (e.g., attention, multi- stream fusion) with deep feature learning are currently at the forefront of research in facial spoof detection. Building upon these foundations, our study adopts a CNN-based architecture trained on standard RGB facial datasets, focusing on accessibility, scalability, and practical deployment. By emphasizing feature learning from real-world attack scenarios, the pro- posed method aims to offer a high-performing yet deployable solution for facial liveness detection. 2.1 Research Gap Despite substantial progress in facial spoof detection, several gaps remain in the current literature that limit the deployment and reliability of anti-spooﬁng systems in real-world scenarios. First, many existing models rely on specialized hardware (e.g., depth sensors, infrared imaging, or dual-camera systems) to enhance spoof detection accuracy. While effective, these methods are impractical for widespread deployment due to cost and hardware 50 A. Alkholid et al. dependency.

Second, handcrafted feature approaches such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) or distortion-based descriptors—often suffer from poor generalization across datasets and environmental conditions (e.g., lighting variation, image quality, and spooﬁng medium). Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have largely addressed this issue, many models in the literature are either too complex for lightweight deployment or lack public implementation in user-friendly interfaces like web applications. Third, the robustness of CNN-based models is typically assessed on individual datasets under laboratory conditions. However, there is a shortage of work demonstrat- ing integrated systems that combine ofﬂine training on large datasets with live, browser- based inference pipelines using lightweight models and heuristics. Bridging this gap would contribute signiﬁcantly to the real-time applicability of facial spoof detection. Fourth, the connection between spoof detection and other facial analysis applications such as emotion recognition, invigilation, or behavioural monitoring is often overlooked.

Steps of spoof detection.  Face Detection: We ﬁrst identiﬁed and isolated the primary facial region within each image, using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classiﬁer [ 17–21] or a deep learning-based detector such as SSD (Single Shot Detector).  Normalization: The cropped facial images were resized to a consistent dimension (e.g., 128 × 128 or 224 × 224 pixels) to meet the input requirements of the CNN. The pixel values were then normalized, typically by scaling them to a range of [0, 1] or standardizing (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation), which helps stabilize the training process and improve convergence.  Data Augmentation: To enhance the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data and improve robustness against variations, we applied data augmentation techniques to the training set. This included random transformations such as horizontal ﬂipping, slight rotations, and minor adjustments to image brightness and contrast. 3.3 Research Model Architecture We implemented a CNN architecture inspired by established models used in image recognition [18].

Instead of deploying the custom-trained research model (which can be complex in a browser environment), the web application utilizes: 1. Pre-trained MobileNet: It loads a standard, publicly available MobileNet model (mobilenet_v1_0.25_224 via MODEL_URL) using TensorFlow.js. MobileNet is a lightweight deep learning model primarily designed for efﬁcient image classiﬁcation on mobile or embedded devices. 2. Image Analysis Heuristics: Since MobileNet itself isn’t speciﬁcally trained for anti- spooﬁng, the application supplements its output with custom image analysis heuristics applied to the detected face region. These heuristics analyze factors like:  Image Variance: Calculates the variance of pixel values, assuming real faces exhibit more texture and thus higher variance than ﬂat printed photos or screen replays.  Edge Detection: Estimates the density of edges within the face region, expecting real faces to have more complex edge patterns. 3.

High precision indicates a low false positive rate (misclassifying real faces as spoofs).  Recall (Sensitivity): Measures the model’s ability to identify all actual positive instances (i.e., of all actual spoofs, how many were correctly detected).

However, some subtle variations were observed. For instance, distinguishing high-quality video replay attacks was occasionally more challenging than detecting simpler print attacks, likely due to the higher ﬁdelity and potential motion cues in video replays. While the achieved accuracy is high, certain limitations and potential avenues for improvement exist. The model’s robustness against entirely unseen spooﬁng methods (zero-shot detection) or highly sophisticated attacks like deepfakes remains an area for further investigation. Future enhancements could involve integrating information from multiple modalities where available (e.g., depth or infrared sensors) or exploring more complex network architectures. Incorporating attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on the most informative parts of the face image, or leveraging transfer learning from large models pre-trained on general face recognition tasks (like FaceNet) could potentially boost performance and generalization capabilities.

The results validate the suitability of deep learning in signiﬁcantly enhancing the security of facial recognition systems against common spooﬁng threats. This robustness suggests that the learned features are not overly tailored to a speciﬁc type of spoof but generalize effectively across various forms of presentation attacks, including print attacks, high-resolution screen replays, and potentially even rudimentary mask attacks present in the datasets. High-quality video replays can closely replicate the appearance and certain dynamic characteristics of a live face, thereby minimizing overt artifacts. The key challenge lies in the model’s ability to detect subtle differences—potentially involving the interaction of light with display surfaces versus human skin, or minor inconsistencies in motion pat- terns—if temporal features are considered. However, our current architecture is primarily image-based and lacks explicit temporal modeling.

Domain adaptation can help mitigate dataset bias across different environments. Multimodal signals like depth and rPPG can enhance spoof resistance. Synthetic data from GANs and diffusion models can support broader attack coverage. Together, these strategies can evolve the system into a more adaptive, secure solution.

While web applications for avatar generation exist [ 1], their inte- gration of sophisticated, AI-driven personalization based on actual user likeness often remains rudimentary.1 The core contribution of this study is the development and empir- ical validation of a novel web-based application that directly tackles these deﬁciencies by integrating advanced facial recognition algorithms with a curated digital artistry frame- work.

The novelty of our approach lies in this dual focus: achieving high-ﬁdelity personalization through facial analysis while simultaneously ensuring the artistic integrity of the generated avatar, a process we term “Artistic Facial Feature Map- ping” (AFFM). We posit that this combination can signiﬁcantly enhance user satisfaction and reduce the cognitive and temporal load typically associated with avatar creation. This research addresses the following fundamental questions: 1. How accurately can a web-based system, integrating facial recognition with a pre- deﬁned artistic component library, translate distinctive human facial features into a personalized digital avatar? 2. To what extent does this integrated approach enhance user satisfaction and the per- ceived likeness of the avatar compared to traditional template-based or manual avatar creation methods? 3.

Such performance metrics remain pertinent for any user- facing web-based system. The concept of personalized content generation has broadened, with multimodal generation models being applied to short video content [ 4], hinting at the potential for dynamic and richly featured avatars.

For skin tone alignment, a rule-based algorithm assigns the nearest tone from a predeﬁned palette, based on average facial region color values extracted during landmark processing. The server-side, built with Python and Flask, handles the computationally intensive tasks: 1. Facial Feature Extraction Module: This module processes the uploaded user image to detect the face and extract key facial landmarks (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth, jawline contours) and attributes (e.g., approximate skin tone, basic face shape). We employ a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the MTCNN (Multi- task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) architecture for face detection and initial landmark localization, followed by a dedicated facial landmark detector (e.g., based on Dlib’s 68-point model) for ﬁner detail. 2.

Curated Art Component Database: This database contains a variety of pre-designed avatar elements (e.g., eye shapes, nose types, mouth expressions, hairstyles, acces- sories), each tagged with metadata describing its stylistic attributes and corresponding facial feature characteristics. This represents the second methodology: a structured, component-based approach to digital artistry. 4.

CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset: This large-scale public dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with rich annotations, including 5 facial landmark locations and 40 binary attribute annotations (e.g., ‘Male’, ‘Smiling’, ‘Y oung’).  URL: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html  Description: We utilized a subset of CelebA (approx. 20,000 images) for ﬁne- tuning our facial landmark detection model and for developing heuristics for attribute classiﬁcation (e.g., deriving face shape from landmark ratios).

With IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, among other offerings, organizations can host applications and store data without investing much in physical infrastructure. However, with the accelerating rate of cloud adoption, data privacy, integrity, and security concerns have mounted. Cloud attacks have grown in numbers and sophistication, and cloud infrastructures have become top targets for cyberattacks [ 1, 2]. Cloud data storage security is required to maintain users’ conﬁdence, regulatory compliance, and safeguard sensitive information. Data stored in healthcare, ﬁnancial, or government systems must be assured of integrity and conﬁdentiality at any cost.

Therefore, offering secure storage facilities is a top priority for cloud service providers and customers [ 2, 3]. Despite using traditional security controls such as encryption, access controls, and intrusion detection, most traditional controls do not belong in today’s dynamic threat environments. They depend on rules and cannot perceive zero-day threats, insider attack- ers, or propagating malware. Centralized security models are also susceptible to a single point of weakness and, hence, are liable to attacks [ 3]. Blockchain offers a tamper-evident and decentralized ledger that ensures data integrity and unambiguous audit trails. AI enhances threat detection with real-time pattern matching and anomaly detection. They collectively provide a complementary solution to construct intelligent and tamper-resistant cloud storage systems [ 4, 5]. This paper aims to explore the feasibility of applying the fusion of blockchain and AI to ensure the security of cloud data storage.

Unauthorized access is a com- mon threat, typically due to weak authentication procedures or stolen credentials. Data breaches can be caused by weakly designed cloud services or attacks on shared infrastruc- tures [ 6, 7]. Accidental data loss due to system failures, human mistakes, or malicious attacks is a perilous threat. These threats reﬂect the insufﬁciency of existing security models and the need for stronger, ﬂexible, and intelligent defense systems. Blockchain technology has been proposed to improve cloud data storage security. Decentralization eliminates reliance on a single authority and, therefore, vulnerability to a single point of failure. Data on a blockchain is cryptographically locked and cannot be deleted or altered, and data is written and, therefore, irreversible. Consensus algorithms add a guarantee and assurance layer, and smart contracts add transparent and automatic access to sensitive information [ 8, 9]. Artiﬁcial Intelligence has also been applied to cloud security with successful out- comes, particularly in real-time threat and anomaly detection. AI systems can monitor users’ activities, detect unusual patterns of access, and neutralize threats independently without human intervention. The systems get smarter over time using historical data,"

The systems get smarter over time using historical data, improving accuracy and responsiveness daily. This also allows cloud security systems to detect new and unknown threats more effectively than the older rule-based systems [ 10, 11]. Though both blockchain and AI have shown independent potential in cloud security, their combination has yet to be developed to its full potential. Existing solutions are disjointed, without coordination between immutable storage and intelligent detection. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by introducing a single AI blockchain solution to attain adaptive, innovative, and tamper-proof data security in cloud computing. 72 S. Prajapati 3 Theoretical Framework 3.1 Blockchain Concepts for Cloud Data Security Blockchain is built on distributed ledger technology, where information is held on a network of nodes rather than a centralized server. This makes it more resistant and theoretically invulnerable to data manipulation without permission. Each transaction or data input is checked by consensus processes and stored in a block to form an irreversible chain. Data integrity is ensured by cryptographic hashing since small changes in data will change the hash value, which could represent tampering. Smart contracts, self- enforceable code on the blockchain, enable automatic and transparent access control, i.e., only registered users can communicate with stored information according to speciﬁed rules [ 12]."

Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks are trained against massive datasets to recognize normal and abnormal behavior patterns. Anomaly detection enables systems to identify suspicious behavior in real-time, and intelligent decision-making algorithms respond automatically to threats without human interven- tion. These AI capabilities provide a dynamic defense layer that reacts automatically to new threats [ 13]. 3.3 Synergy of AI and Blockchain The combination of blockchain and AI is a strong cloud data protection solution. Blockchain provides data integrity and access transparency, while AI offers intelli- gent detection and response. Combined, they are offering a two-layered solution where blockchain guarantees the form of data and AI safeguards against its misuse. The com- bination provides real-time anomaly detection and ﬁxed logging of access and data modiﬁcation [14]. 3.4 Core Deﬁnitions and Scope of Framework The study is about structured and semi-structured cloud data, such as transaction logs, user passwords, and logs.

Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) has signiﬁcantly improved malware clas- siﬁcation by enhancing detection accuracy and efﬁciency.

The impact of these threats is substan- tial, ranging from crippling ﬁnancial losses and theft of sensitive personal or corporate data to the disruption of critical infrastructure and even threats to national security [ 3]. Initially, signature-based detection was the primary defense, scanning ﬁles for known malicious patterns. While effective against known threats, this approach struggled with new malware variants and evasion techniques like polymorphism [ 4]. This necessitated a shift towards more dynamic and intelligent defense mechanisms. Machine Learning and Deep Learning emerged as tools, identifying patterns even in unseen threats. How- ever, their complexity often results in “black box” models, where understanding why a decision is made is difﬁcult. This lack of transparency is a signiﬁcant hurdle for secu- rity analysts who need to validate alerts and understand threat vectors [ 5].

Its main weakness was its inability to detect novel threats or variants designed to evade static [ 7, 8]. This led to analysis, which uses rules to ﬁnd characteristics of malicious intent.  Static Analysis: Inspects code and structure without execution (PE headers, API calls, strings, opcodes). Its effectiveness can be diminished by obfuscation and packing [ 9, 10].  Dynamic Analysis: Runs malware in a controlled sandbox to observe behavior (sys- tem calls, ﬁle access, network activity). Attackers use anti-sandbox techniques to evade this [ 11, 12].  Hybrid Analysis: Combines static and dynamic techniques to overcome individual limitations [ 13]. Despite these advancements, traditional methods struggled with the volume and innovation of modern malware, highlighting the need for ML [ 14]. 2.3 The Rise of Machine Learning in Malware Classiﬁcation ML offered the ability to automatically learn distinguishing patterns from vast datasets of benign and malicious samples, enabling the detection of novel threats [ 13]. Early ML applications focused on feature engineering, extracting characteristics for algorithms to process [ 15].  Static Features: Opcode sequences [ 16], API call frequencies [ 17], PE header info, string properties [ 14], byte sequence patterns (sometimes as images) [ 18]."

LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations): Approximates black- box model behavior locally with a simpler model, highlighting inﬂuential features for a speciﬁc prediction by perturbing inputs [ 44].

The methodology is primarily derived from the procedures outlined in the provided Jupyter Notebook (malware-det.ipynb). 3.1 Dataset and Preprocessing The MalwareData.csv dataset is a collection of features extracted from the headers of Portable Executable (PE) ﬁles, which are the standard ﬁle format for executables, object code, and DLLs in 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems. The primary purpose of this dataset is to facilitate a binary classiﬁcation task: determining whether a given ﬁle is malicious (malware) or legitimate (benign). 86 F. Muça and W. Ahmad The study utilized the “MalwareData.csv” dataset, containing features extracted from Portable Executable (PE) ﬁles. The dataset is composed of 138,047 instances (rows), each representing a unique ﬁle, and 57 features (columns). The ﬁrst two columns, Name and md5, serve as unique identiﬁers for each ﬁle sample and are generally excluded from the model training process. There are 54 numerical columns that represent speciﬁc attributes extracted from the PE headers. These features capture various characteristics of the ﬁles, including:  Header Information: Machine, SizeOfOptionalHeader, Characteristics.  Memory Layout: ImageBase, SectionAlignment, SizeOfImage, SizeOfStackReserve.  Code and Data Sizes: SizeOfCode, SizeOfInitializedData, SizeOfUninitializedData."

The consistency observed in LIME explanations (for instance, recurring thresholds for ImageBase) is particularly valuable for analysts seeking reliable and trustworthy local interpretations.  Gradient Boosting: While this classiﬁer achieved marginally superior performance metrics, this fractional gain was weighed against the qualitative output of the XAI frameworks. It presented slightly more complex and instance-variable LIME expla- nations, and while SHAP could still identify clear global patterns, the local inter- pretability was less straightforward than Random Forest’s. This highlights a common theme in XAI: the highest-performing models can be the most intricate and thus harder to explain consistently at a local level."

SHAP clearly showed the linear impact of features, and LIME identiﬁed simple thresholds. However, this interpretability came at a signiﬁcant cost in performance, as the model oversimpliﬁed the complex, non-linear relationships inherent in the data.  Gaussian Naïve Bayes: The XAI results mirrored its poor performance. SHAP showed weak and scattered feature impacts, and LIME produced illogical or uninformative thresholds, conﬁrming the model failed to learn meaningful patterns from the data. 5.3 Practical Implications for Cybersecurity Analysts The ability to explain why a model ﬂags a ﬁle as malicious is paramount in cybersecurity operations. For high-performing models like Random Forest, SHAP summary plots can help analysts understand the general tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) these models associate with malware, such as the use of unusual ImageBase values or high section entropy. This global understanding can inform threat hunting rules or adjustments to security posture. At a local level, LIME explanations can provide instance-speciﬁc evidence for an alert. An analyst seeing that a ﬁle was ﬂagged due to a low ImageBase and a high SectionsMaxEntropy can use this actionable information to prioritize their investigation or correlate the event with other threat intelligence."

Explainable AI for Malware Classiﬁcation: Bridging the Gap 95 6 Limitations and Future Work 6.1 Limitations This study was intentionally scoped to evaluate the efﬁcacy of XAI techniques on static PE features. This approach was chosen to ﬁrst establish a foundational baseline on readily available data before introducing the greater complexities of dynamic, behavioral anal- ysis. However, this focus on static analysis means the models are not exposed to runtime behaviors, and thus may be vulnerable to modern evasion techniques like polymorphism or anti-sandbox checks that are only observable during execution. The ﬁndings are based on a single dataset (‘MalwareData.csv’); consequently, while the results are promising, their generalizability to different malware corpuses, other executable formats, or emerging threats may be limited. Furthermore, the computational cost of certain XAI techniques, particularly KernelSHAP , remains a practical barrier for real-time applications on larger datasets, warranting further investigation into more efﬁcient methods. Finally, this research does not include an active evaluation of the models’ robustness against adversarial attacks. The transparency afforded by XAI techniques presents a paradox; by revealing the key features a model relies on, it may provide a roadmap for malicious actors to subtly modify payloads to evade detection. 6.2 Future Work"

First, future work should expand the feature set to incorporate dynamic analysis features, such as system call sequences and network behavior, to build more resilient classiﬁers and explore the corresponding XAI interpretations. Second, investigating advanced deep learning models, such as CNNs on malware images or LSTMs for sequential data, and applying model-speciﬁc XAI techniques like Grad-CAM would be a valuable next step. A crucial third step is to conduct user studies with cybersecurity analysts to quanti- tatively validate the practical utility and actionability of these explanations in real-world SOC environments. Fourth, research into addressing computational costs is needed to mitigate the overhead of XAI techniques for large-scale deployment. This could involve exploring more computationally efﬁcient XAI methods or advanced sampling strategies for SHAP . Finally, exploring hybrid XAI approaches that combine different methods could provide richer, multi-faceted explanations for security professionals. 7 Conclusions This research successfully demonstrated the application and comparative effectiveness of machine learning models for malware classiﬁcation, critically extending the analysis to the domain of Explainable AI (XAI) to interpret their complex decision-making"

To address scalability, the hierar- chical architecture employs queuing theory and epidemic spread models for data ﬂow optimization across four tiers: 1.5 GB (individual), 10 TB (clinical), 1,000 TB (regional), and 20,000 TB (national). Grid computing clusters at the secondary tier enable distributed processing, supported by middleware that reduces latency by 41% compared to centralized cloud systems.

Dysfunction of the respiratory system results in alterations in the functional state of its organs, which can be detected through changes in respiratory acoustics.

These solutions can alleviate the burden on frontline healthcare, especially during public health crises. This study addresses a globally relevant scientiﬁc challenge: the development of AI- based systems for the detection of lung diseases using respiratory sound analysis [13–15]. Speciﬁcally, it focuses on multi-channel acoustic signal acquisition and processing for the diagnosis of pulmonary conditions, including respiratory pathologies associated with COVID-19 [ 16–18]. We propose a scalable telemedicine system that integrates calibrated multi-channel acoustic sensors with a hybrid deep learning model—combining CNN and RNN architectures—for joint spectral–temporal feature extraction. V ariable frequency resolutions are employed to enhance detection sensitivity across distinct bands.

Density distribution of acoustic noise values during different phases of respiration: (a) distribution by respiratory phases—1, 3: emission; 2, 4: pause; 1, 2 represent the left lung, and 3, 4 represent the right lung; (b) overall respiratory process—1: left lung, 2: right lung. This indicates that the type of statistical distribution—when normalized by RMS—is not a reliable distinguishing feature for detecting pathological respiratory conditions. In both inhalation and exhalation states, the noise characteristics conform well to standard Gaussian models. However, the overall noise distribution of the full respiratory process deviates from a single Gaussian shape and is better modeled using a poly-Gaussian distribution. Consequently, a suitable simulation model for respiratory acoustic signal (RAS) should be based on semi-Markov nested processes [ 19, 20], an approach previously applied to model non-stationary, non-Gaussian interference in environmental monitoring"

Such interference typically arises from reﬂections of complex surfaces (e.g., land, sea), atmospheric layers, and clear-sky conditions [ 20]. 3 Spectral Analysis and Visualization of RAS Respiration is a fundamentally non-stationary process, with acoustic characteristics vary- ing signiﬁcantly between inspiration and expiration. To capture this spectral variability, average power spectra and spectrograms were computed at multiple frequency resolu- tions for lung sounds during normal vesicular breathing (Fig. 4), using three frequency resolutions tailored for different diagnostic purposes: high resolution (0.67 Hz) to detect ﬁne pathological features such as crackles and wheezes; medium resolution (10.77 Hz) to identify dominant spectral patterns; and low resolution (43.07 Hz) to enable computa- tionally efﬁcient real-time processing and initial anomaly screening. In healthy subjects, the spectral power of the left and right lungs remains largely symmetrical under both normal and slightly attenuated conditions, providing a baseline for identifying abnor- malities. As shown in Fig. 5a, healthy lungs exhibit minimal inter-lung spectral dif- ferences, whereas pathological cases present marked discrepancies in the differential spectra (Fig. 5b), reﬂecting impaired respiratory function. These phase-speciﬁc spectral features are reliable indicators of pulmonary pathology [ 21, 22]."

More diagnostically informative, however, are the averaged and differential spectra calculated separately for the inhalation and exhalation phases. These phases are extracted using threshold-based segmentation methods applied to the temporal waveforms of RAS, as described in previous work [ 23–27]. Once the phases are isolated, their average spectral proﬁles are computed. Figure 6 presents these spectra for the left (healthy) and right (pathological) lungs. The pathology, in this case early-stage pneumonia, reveals itself through a noticeable suppression of low-frequency (LF) components and an elevation in high-frequency (HF) noise. The suppression may exceed 20 dB in the 500–1000 Hz range, while HF ampliﬁcation reaches 5–12 dB in the 2000–4000 Hz range.

A nested semi-Markov process is employed to model the respiratory cycle, capturing inhalation, suspension, and exhalation phases through sta- tistical descriptors such as duration distributions, instantaneous and average spectra. Diagnosis is performed by analyzing spectrograms, amplitude variations (e.g., mean fre- quency, root mean square), and spectral energy. Multidimensional features are extracted from both temporal and spectral domains.

Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) workﬂows have remained pillars of data engineer- ing today, where data is ingested, processed, and stored for analytical and operational purposes.

Traditional ETL workﬂows have limitations in their performance, including their capability to handle data of high volume and velocity. These limitations bring computational overhead, slow data access, and poor resource utilization on available machinery.

Rongala 1.1 Motivation ETL workﬂows play vital roles in data organization and data processing of structured and unstructured data collected from multiple data sources and loading them into data analytics systems or data warehouses. The traditional ETL architecture employs static data partitioning and data processing in sequence, where data is partitioned into static chunks and processed in an independent, workload-variation-insensitive fashion. Such methodology creates resource bottlenecks, execution time, and scalability, particularly in mixed datasets with uneven workloads. Furthermore, data processing latency is becoming an omnipresent challenge as data volumes grow exponentially. Adopting sequential execution constrains performance by requiring single-threaded operation and, hence, data processing lag. Further, inadequate data partitioning creates an uneven workload, where few processing nodes remain idle while others bear excessive workloads, contributing to poor parallel execution [ 4]. The lack of intelligent resource allocation mechanisms makes such performance bottlenecks worse. In this paper, AI-enabled strategies for on-the-ﬂy parallelization and partition- ing using machine learning have been studied, and such strategies have good poten-"

In this paper, AI-enabled strategies for on-the-ﬂy parallelization and partition- ing using machine learning have been studied, and such strategies have good poten- tial to enhance ETL pipeline performance by utilizing machine learning for workload adaptability. Such methodology creates resource bottlenecks, increases execution time, and limits scalability, particularly in mixed datasets with uneven workloads. Studies have shown that static data partitioning can lead to up to 40% underutilization of cluster resources in heterogeneous data processing environments (Selvarajan, [ 3]). This inefﬁciency results from ﬁxed-size partitions not aligning with real-time data or workload variability, causing some computation nodes to become overloaded while others remain idle. 1.2 Problem Deﬁnition While traditional ETL structures have succeeded in small data settings, their efﬁciency is gradually compromised in large and composite datasets, where speedy executions are required. The major challenge in such contexts is slow data processing, were sequential data ﬂow and poor workload partitioning lead to prolonged data loading and transfor- mation. Ineffective resource use is also an aftermath of static partitioning mechanisms, where CPU and memory cannot fully be exploited, and workload is unevenly partitioned between computing nodes. The lack of efﬁciency is in operation and computational cost, where poorly optimized ETL ﬂows result in wasteful power consumption, increased equipment cost, and poor resource use.

In recent decades, various data engineers and scholars have developed multiple data engineering and movement strategies to optimize ETL, focusing on data parti- tioning, parallel computation, and automatic piping. Rule-based data transformation, indexing, data caches, and data movement through data-parallel computation systems such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark have conventionally optimized ETL. These strategies maximize response time, optimize resources, and provide scalability [ 1, 2]. Several studies have focused on static and dynamic partitioning strategies to par- tition data between computational nodes effectively. Static partitioning divides data into chunks of ﬁxed lengths, which are processed in isolation. In contrast, dynamic partitioning alters partition size and the approach to execution based on workload sce- narios. Research on distributed ETL systems suggests parallel execution to improve performance, but standard partitioning strategies lead to workload imbalance and low resource utilization [ 4]. Further, data pipeline automation is becoming prominent, using workﬂow schedulers and orchestration tools such as Apache Airﬂow to optimize ETL execution. However, these rule-based strategies lack real-time ﬂexibility, so AI-powered optimization strategies must be adopted to optimize ETL performance. 2.2 Traditional V ersus AI-Driven Approaches Traditional ETL parallelism strategies have emphasized multiprocessing, multithread- ing, and batch processing for better performance.

Optimizing ETL Pipeline Performance with AI-Driven Data 119 2.3 Key Challenges in Scaling ETL Despite advancements in optimizing ETL, several limitations and inefﬁcient data han- dling for large datasets persist. Load imbalance is one such issue, where data partitioning is uneven, and computation nodes become overloaded, degrading system performance. Load imbalance is most evident in heterogeneous datasets, where data partitions have dif- ferent computational resource needs. Skewed partitioning is another issue, where data partitions have disproportionately more extensive and computationally intensive data transformations than their counterparts, computation is delayed, and poor parallelism is achieved [ 9, 10]. Memory constraints also impact ETL scalability, particularly in on-demand provi- sioned computational systems in the cloud. Ineffective data chunking and caching mech- anisms cause excessive memory usage and escalating costs. In addition, low-latency data manipulation required in real-time ETL scenarios, such as data stream processing, cannot be achieved by standard batch-oriented ETL practices. These constraints point towards an evolved, adaptive ETL system capable of optimizing partitioning strategies in real-time and resource load balancing [ 11]. 2.4 Gap Analysis"

The traditional parallelism strategies lack innovative workload partitioning mechanisms and have low resource utilization. Recent studies address distributed computing systems such as Apache Spark, but their implementations have partition and scheduler parameters to ﬁne-tune.

AI-optimized partitioning manages data chunk sizes adaptively, so the workload is effectively partitioned and load-balanced between computation nodes. Hence, response time is lowered by 40% and resource consumption by 30%. The evidence also illustrates that AI-optimized ETL is scalable better than standard strategies for larger dataset sizes and, thus, is an efﬁcient solution for data processing in large-scale applications in real-time scenarios. Despite these advantages, trade-offs must be made. AI partitioning is computation- ally costly for machine learning models and sometimes inﬂuences real-time behavior. Second, the AI model optimizing for partitioning must have access to prior performance data, so the solution is optimal for lengthy deploys but not for ad-hoc ETL jobs.

Scalability in dis- tributed systems is also a disadvantage, where AI-assisted workload balancing may require additional tuning while operating in highly dynamic cloud-based ETL systems. Future studies must include real-time streaming ETL systems such as Apache Kafka and Apache Flink to ensure low-latency data processing using AI-driven partitioning adaptability to optimize AI-enabled ETL further. Lightweight AI models might also be developed to constrain computational overhead to ensure efﬁcient, timely partitioning decisions for real-time workload partitioning. RL models are also attractive, where par- titioning strategies adapt and optimize constantly in response to data behavior changes. Hybrid ETL strategies, where data processing in batches and streams is blended to pro- vide greater ﬂexibility, scalability, and adaptability in data processing, is an area for future studies [ 9, 10, 12].

CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Comput- ers and Humans Apart) is a widely used security mechanism designed to distin- guish human users from automated bots by presenting challenges that are simple for humans but difﬁcult for machines.

This study investigates the vulnerability of text-based CAPTCHAs to attacks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), building on Kumar et al.’s [ 2] ﬁnding that 70% of text CAPTCHAs are susceptible to basic CNN models. The objective is to automate the recognition and transcription of CAPTCHA images and to evaluate the CNN’s performance in terms of accuracy and robustness. By examining weaknesses in CAPTCHA systems, this project highlights the growing need for more advanced user authentication methods. As Guerar et al. [ 3] aptly stated, “The human-or-computer dilemma has entered its most critical phase.” Therefore, it is crucial to identify and address areas of vulnerability to enhance digital security and safeguard assets. 2 Literature Review 2.1 Context The vulnerability of CAPTCHA systems to machine learning attacks has received con- siderable attention in recent years. Kumar et al.’s [ 2] comprehensive review of 23 CAPTCHA schemes established baseline vulnerabilities, showing that basic Convolu- tional Neural Networks (CNNs) were able to crack 68% of text CAPTCHAs across ﬁve trials. Their study also demonstrated that standard security features, such as character overlap, offered minimal protection—improving resilience by only 22%—thus raising serious doubts about the viability of text-based CAPTCHAs.

Using these metrics, Noury and Rezaei [ 4] developed Deep-CAPTCHA, a custom 12-layer CNN that achieved 95.1% accuracy against reCAPTCHA systems. Its use of alternating kernel sizes (3 × 3 and 5 × 5) and focal loss optimization (γ = 2) reduced processing time to 3.2 s per image, demonstrating that distortion-based CAPTCHA security can be systematically bypassed. The efﬁciency threshold was further explored by Lu et al. [ 5], whose CNN—based on depth wise separable convolutions with skip connections—achieved real-time performance (2.3 s per image) on mobile platforms at 89% accuracy, marking a signiﬁcant step toward practical deployment. The arms race continued with Y e et al.’s [ 6] two-pronged GAN framework, which achieved 98.2% accuracy in breaking CAPTCHAs while simultaneously generating adversarial examples that reduced machine recognition rates to just 11.7%. This seem- ingly contradictory progress, enabled by a 9-block residual generator with perceptual loss (λ = 10), exposed the inherent vulnerabilities of ﬁxed CAPTCHA solutions. Even image-based CAPTCHAs proved insecure, as demonstrated by Alqahtani and Alsu- laiman [ 7], whose transfer learning attacks achieved 89.4% accuracy on standard image tests and 76.8% on distorted versions—where rotation invariance yielded less than a 15% improvement.

Gutub and Kheshaifaty’s [ 9] study of 1,200 users quantiﬁed a Defeating CAPTCHAs with CNN-Based Image Recognition 129 fundamental trade-off: while graphical CAPTCHAs provided modest security improve- ments (91% vs. 88% success rates), they resulted in 62% longer solve times (6.8 s vs. 4.2 s) and signiﬁcantly lower user preference scores (2.8/5 vs. 4.1/5), revealing critical usability limitations. 2.2 Current Research Jiang et al.

While various studies have proposed new CAPTCHA schemes, many still rely on outdated security mechanisms that can be easily circum- vented by modern CNN models. Additionally, there is limited research on real-time, scal- able solutions that can prevent attacks across different types of CAPTCHAs, including 130 A.

The effective- ness of these strategies in the face of evolving machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, remains underexplored. Furthermore, research on the trade-offs between security and usability in advanced CAPTCHA systems is insufﬁcient.

These steps have been applied in accordance with the requirements of the CNN and the dataset to achieve optimal performance. 3.1 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing In this study, we used a dataset of 1,070 text-based CAPTCHA images obtained from Kaggle. Distortions, speciﬁcally blur and occlusion lines, were applied to the images, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. CAPTCHA Dataset. The dataset was uploaded and processed using a Google Colab notebook. To pre- pare for the subsequent steps, labels were extracted, and basic operations, such as deter- mining the maximum number of characters and analyzing character distribution, were performed. After data acquisition, the images undergo several preprocessing steps (as shown in Fig. 2) to make them suitable for the model. In our approach, the preprocessing pipeline consists of the following: • Grayscale Conversion: Reduces computational complexity while retaining essential features for character recognition. • Adaptive Thresholding: Facilitates image binarization and simpliﬁes character segmentation. • Morphological Operations: Includes closing and dilation. • Gaussian Filtering: Applied for image smoothing and noise reduction. • Fixed Slicing: Divides the CAPTCHA image into equal sections, where each character is expected to appear, as illustrated in Fig. 2 (Preprocessing Steps)."

Preprocessing Steps. 3.2 Feature Extraction The preprocessed data is then fed into the model. Since our approach utilizes a Con- volutional Neural Network (CNN), the feature extraction process is performed within the CNN itself. The model consists of three convolutional blocks, each comprising the following: • A convolution layer with ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity [ 14], given by Eq. ( 1): f (x) = max(0, x )(1) • Batch Normalization to stabilize learning. • Dropout (0.2) for regularization. • Max pooling to reduce dimensionality while retaining important features, as shown in Eq. ( 2): Pi,j = max(m,n RFi+m,j+n (2) where R is the pooling region [ 15]. The ﬁrst layer detects edges, the middle layer recognizes shapes by combining the edges to identify letter components, and the ﬁnal layer identiﬁes the complete letter parts, thereby completing the feature extraction process. 3.3 Classiﬁcation After passing through the convolutional layers, the feature maps are ﬂattened and fed into two fully connected layers, followed by a softmax output layer with a number of nodes equal to the number of unique character classes, see Eq.

Alkholid et al. 3.4 Data Augmentation and Oversampling After the model is created, two techniques are employed to enhance its perfor- mance: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and Data Augmenta- tion. SMOTE is used to address class imbalance, speciﬁcally the uneven distribution of characters, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Character Distribution. Then the resampled data is reshaped and fed into an ImageDataGenerator with rota- tion range ±5, and width shift ±2 pixels to improve generalization, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 4.

Distortions, including blur and occlusion lines, are present in the images, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. CAPTCHA Image Sample.

Despite some ﬂuctuations in training accuracy, the validation metrics remained stable throughout the training process. This behavior indicates good generalization capabilities and the absence of overﬁtting, as shown in Fig. 6. 134 A. Alkholid et al. Fig. 6. Loss and Accuracy over Epoch Graphs. From the ﬁrst graph, we observe that the training loss (blue line) ﬂuctuates over time, suggesting instability, possibly due to the small batch size. The validation loss (orange line), on the other hand, remains relatively ﬂat with a slight downward trend, indicating improvement over time. Similarly, the training accuracy graph (blue line) shows high- frequency oscillations between 88% and 95%, reﬂecting dynamic learning behavior and sensitivity to individual batches. Despite this volatility, the model consistently learns and maintains high accuracy. Meanwhile, the validation accuracy (orange line) remains steady, ﬂuctuating only slightly around 87–88%, which reﬂects strong and consistent generalization performance.

Other options such as image puzzles (e.g., selecting all images containing a particular object), audio CAPTCHAs (which may be harder for bots to translate), and behavior analysis (mon- itoring user interaction pattern like mouse movements, keystrokes, or scrolls) offer more secure alternatives. The use of multi-factor challenges, with multiple levels of veriﬁcation, also provides enhanced security through increased difﬁculty for potential attackers. Brieﬂy, the results necessitate an immediate paradigm shift in CAPTCHA design.

Keywords: Corpus Callosum · Segmentation · Deep Learning · Mask R-CNN 1 Introduction The corpus callosum (CC) represents the largest white matter tract within the central nervous system. The CC not only connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain, but also organizes communication between them [ 1]. The accurate segmentation of CC in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the diagnosis and ongoing assessment of numerous neurological and psychiatric conditions, like multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism spectrum disorders [ 2, 3].

Mask R-CNN was adapted successfully for various medical imaging applications [ 5–8]. However, limited research has speciﬁcally addressed the use of Mask R-CNN for segmentation of brain structures such as CC, which poses unique challenges due to its shape, location, and variability across patients. The segmentation of CC in MR images has been a longstanding topic of interest in neuroimaging research, due to its clinical signiﬁcance in assessing brain connectivity and detecting abnormalities. Earlier techniques relied on geometric modelling, intensity- based thresholding or atlas-based registration for segmentation of CC [ 9, 10].

On the other hand, several traditional and machine learning based methods have been proposed for CC segmentation [ 11–13]. There are some deep learning-based approaches for CC segmentation that have been previously proposed. In a deep learning CNN model based on the U-Net architecture designed for CC segmentation, Chandra et al. [ 14] used benchmark MR datasets such as ABIDE and OASIS. The results of the proposed model have been compared with state-of-the-art architectures, and structural measures like CC and total brain area are obtained using the outputs of the model. The obtained measurements were used to clas- sify autism spectrum disorder and control groups. Similarly, Brusini et al. [15] developed a deep learning-based method for automatic segmentation of CC atrophy in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. This method incorporated CNN with U-Net architecture, which performed segmentation of CC and intracranial (IC) areas using 3D T1-weighted and FLAIR MR images. The developed model showed high performance in terms of segmen- tation. In another study, Platten et al. [ 16] developed a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm that can quickly and accurately assess CC atrophy in MS patients.

In the ﬁrst stage, the ABIDE CC dataset serves as the basis of the study. This dataset comprises sagittal T1-weighted structural MRI scans acquired from subjects at different locations. The dataset is subjected to a preprocessing stage that includes image normalization, resizing, and format standardization. This is followed by random partitioning into three subsets: training, validation and test sets. This partitioning is critical to ensure unbiased model evaluation and to avoid overﬁtting. The second stage involves training the proposed Mask R-CNN model, which is built on a ResNet101 back- bone to enable efﬁcient feature extraction. Both training and validation sets are applied to the model. Training is performed iteratively and model checkpoints are evaluated against the validation set to identify the best performing epoch. This optimal model checkpoint is then used for testing on unseen data. Finally, in the segmentation stage, the best model is applied to the test images, resulting in an accurate and fully automated segmentation of the CC.

In this study, T1-weighted MR slices in the mid-sagittal plane were used for CC segmentation. However, due to its polycentric nature, the ABIDE dataset contains image heterogeneity in terms of factors such as equipment, acquisition protocols and magnetic ﬁeld strength. This is beneﬁcial for testing the overall performance of the model, but also increases the importance of the normalization and data standardization steps. Fig. 2.

On mid-sagittal sections, the four com- ponents of the corpus callosum are clearly visualized, situated beneath the cingulate gyrus and cingulate sulcus, and above the lateral ventricles [ 18].

By focusing on 2D slices, especially those where the CC is anatomically centralized, the model training becomes more efﬁcient and feasible. Standardizing such variability is more manageable in 2D, allowing effective histogram normalization and intensity scaling on a slice-by-slice basis. 2.2 Pre-processing Procedures Because the ABIDE dataset contains MRI images from different sources, the ‘Level’ and ‘Window’ levels in the standard brain window vary. As shown in Fig. 3a, when the standard brain intensity levels are applied to the MR images in the ABIDE dataset, the MR image was not displayed at the required intensity level. To eliminate this, Fig. 3b was obtained by taking 10 times the values for ‘Level’ and ‘Window’ of the standard brain intensity levels for all MR images in the ABIDE database. Fig. 3.

Mask R-CNN is a deep learning-based architecture originally proposed for object detection and semantic segmentation, which can be performed simultaneously [4]. The structure of this architecture builds on the Faster R-CNN architecture [ 19] and includes an additional pixel-level mask prediction layer for each region of interest (RoI). This allows for both classiﬁcation and positioning information as well as instance segmentation of each object. The Mask R-CNN architecture consists of three main components: backbone net- work, region proposal network (RPN), and RoIAlign, as shown in Fig. 6. In the ﬁrst stage of the Mask R-CNN architecture, a backbone network, typically consisting of pre-trained convolutional neural networks such as ResNet50 and ResNet101, is used for basic feature extraction.

In the second stage, the RPN is used to identify potential object regions in the image and generate the necessary RoIs [ 20]. In the ﬁnal stage, these RoIs are normalized using a precise alignment technique called RoIAlign to perform classiﬁcation, position estimation (bounding box regression), and pixel-level mask esti- mation. In particular, the RoIAlign component in the Mask R-CNN architecture replaces the RoIPool used in Faster R-CNN, ensuring that spatial accuracy is maintained, which is a great advantage in tasks where ﬁne details are important, such as medical image segmentation. The effectiveness of Mask R-CNN in medical image segmentation has been demon- strated in many studies. It is particularly preferred for structural brain images due to its high segmentation accuracy and precise separation of small anatomical structures [ 21]. In our study, this architecture provides a suitable framework for segmenting the thin and curved anatomical structure of the corpus callosum, minimizing manual effort thanks to the bounding masks learned directly from the data, creating a scalable solution for clinical applications.

Nevertheless, the model consistently and accurately delineates the CC structure across diverse sagittal MR slices. Fig. 10. Some MR slices segmented with lower DSC score using the proposed Mask R-CNN method in ABIDE dataset 4 Discussion and Conclusions In this study, a fully automated segmentation framework based on the Mask R-CNN architecture with a ResNet101 backbone was developed and applied to MR images to accurately delineate the CC, a critical brain structure associated with several neurode- velopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Using the ABIDE dataset, which includes structural MR images from individuals with ASD and typically developing controls, the proposed system was trained and evaluated to demonstrate its robustness and reliability in clinical imaging scenarios. The ﬁndings indicate that the model attained high seg- mentation accuracy, with a DSC of 94.8%, which shown that the proposed method can accurately identify and segment the CC region.

The study demonstrates that deep learning-based instance segmentation models, such as the Mask R-CNN, can offer signiﬁcant advantages over traditional segmentation techniques by providing automated, consistent and accurate results in neuroimaging analyses. From a clinical perspective, automated CC segmentation has the potential to assist neurologists and radiologists in quantifying morphological changes, monitoring dis- ease progression and supporting early diagnosis, particularly in the context of ASD, multiple sclerosis and other neurological conditions. The ability to integrate such tools into radiological workﬂows can reduce inter-observer variability and improve diagnostic objectivity. Despite the promising results, there are some limitations. The current model Fully Automated Segmentation of Corpus Callosum Using Mask R-CNN 153 was trained and validated on 2D slices, which may not fully capture 3D anatomical con- tinuity. In addition, the study focused on a speciﬁc anatomical region and dataset, which may limit its generalizability to other populations and imaging protocols.

These metrics could then be correlated with clinical indicators of ASD severity, such as behavioral scores and neuropsycho- logical assessments, in order to investigate potential disease biomarkers. Additionally, applying the model to longitudinal MRI datasets would allow for the tracking of CC structural changes over time, providing valuable insight into the neurodevelopmental trajectories in individuals with ASD. Second, implementing a 3D segmentation architec- ture could provide more consistent anatomical results by capturing spatial context across adjacent slices, thereby improving segmentation performance in challenging anatomical regions. Additionally, domain adaptation techniques could be explored to increase the model’s generalizability across different MRI protocols, scanner types, and populations with various neurological or psychiatric conditions. Third, extending the segmenta- tion framework to perform multi-class labeling of additional neuroanatomical structures could support more comprehensive morphometric analyses and facilitate broader appli- cations in brain mapping.

Grandes Ecoles, Libreville BP 1989, Gabon 7 Bridges for Academic Excellence - Spectrum, Tunis, Center-Ville, Tunisia Abstract. This paper describes the development of a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system for assessing uterine conditions. The MA TLAB environment was used to calculate features for image and feature extraction. While some feature functions were readily available, most had to be manually developed using mathe- matical formulas and algorithms to compute speciﬁc features. The process begins with pre-processing ultrasound images, which involves resizing them to 200 x 200 pixels. Pre-existing functions are then applied to extract relevant features. After several experimental iterations to optimize results, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to reduce 40,000 features to 198, which were then used for training. The proposed method classiﬁes images using artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) and provides an interface that demonstrates the system’s functionality by inputting feature information. The main steps include image extraction, compar- ison with matrix values, and classiﬁcation into categories like normal, ﬁbroid, or ovarian cyst. The signiﬁcance of this research lies in its potential to assist radiolo- gists and doctors in accurately identifying the location and type of uterine diseases, thereby reducing the risk of misdiagnoses that could jeopardize patient health.

Using PCA, images of uterine features are represented as a reduced feature space. For training and testing purposes, these features are also introduced in the ANN. In this study, we use the MA T- LAB environment to calculate image features and extract features. While some feature functions were already programmed in the environment, most had to be manually elabo- rated by taking into consideration speciﬁc features and using mathematical formulas and algorithms.

An analysis of 180 measurements revealed that the Vscan measurements were 0.3–0.4 cm lower than the high-resolution US device (V oluson) [ 16].

The underlying principle here is that the “most important” elements of the data feature extraction are typically found in low-level components. 3.1 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors Working with large matrices can be time-consuming in terms of computation. For a single calculation, large matrices may need to be repeated thousands of times. Indeed, without signiﬁcant mathematical tools, studying the behaviour of matrices is both impractical and difﬁcult. The concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is a mathematical regime that has applications in many ﬁelds, including linear algebra, differential equations, and calculus. The terms eigenvalues and eigenvectors are derived from the German word “Eigen”, meaning “property” or “attribute.” The eigenvalues of a square matrix are scalars denoted by the Greek letter λ (lambda), and its eigenvectors are nonzero vectors 160 A.

Eigenvectors have the following characteristics: • It is only possible to determine them for square matrices. • In an N × N matrix, there are N eigenvectors (and corresponding eigenva lues). • All eigenvectors are perpendicular or orthogonal to each other. As each eigenvector is paired with a corresponding eigenvalue, the couple is referred to as an eigenpair. An eigenspace is a space that contains all eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue. Since it is derived from the probability distribution of a covariance matrix of the high-dimensional vector space of the human uterus, Eigen’s uterus is essentially a collection of eigenvectors. Each eigenvector is associated with an eigenvalue, an x and that correspond to one another are often referred to as an Eigen pair.

A statistical compression from 40,000 to 198” typically refers to a dimensionality reduction technique or data compression method where a high-dimensional dataset (originally with 40,000 features or data points) has been reduced to a much lower-dimensional representation (with just 198 features), while preserving as much relevant information as possible. Although this matrix is small in size, it does not represent the covariance matrix. Instead, it allows us to extract vectors of high importance, namely 198 eigenvectors out of 40,000. Extracting vectors and their associated values from such a small matrix is 162 A. Radman et al. possible, though the extracted vectors are short in length (that is, 198 eigenvectors with 198 lengths). Consequently, the vectors must be lengthened from 198 to 40,000 by multiplying each small vector by the matrix (Φ), to produce 198 eigenvectors with 40,000 lengths. However, these are not unit vectors, therefore each long vector is divided by its own length to ﬁnd a 198-unit vector with 40,000 lengths. The resulting unit vectors are identical to the most important vectors that we were initially trying to extract from the large-size dispersion matrix. This concept is well-defended in mathematical literature [ 17]. Fig. 3. Original image. Fig. 4. Compressed image. The resulting vectors are denoted by the symbol (Ui). There are 198-unit vectors,"

There are 198-unit vectors, each of which is composed of 40,000 components. The picture of the uterus represents the input and consists of 200 rows and 200 columns, that is, 40,000 pixels. The image is converted into a vector with 40,000 components, and the average vector is subtracted (Ψ). In effect, the image of the uterus becomes a zero-mean vector. It can be symbolized by the symbol (z). This vector is multiplied by each of the 198 previous unit vectors to get 198 features. These 198 features constitute the most important characteristics of the uterus in the input image. As such, through the application of PCA technology, the original uterine ultrasound image has been reduced from 40,000 to 198 without compromising the most important features of the image. Step 5: Selecting the principal components After determining the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, we must select the principal components. The eigenvectors (Eigenuterus), Ui, and corresponding eigenvalues, λi, should be calculated in this step. Only M should be chosen from the N eigenvectors, U, as it possesses the highest eigenvalues. The more distinct the uterine features are described by the eigenvector, the higher the eigenvalue.

We computed features for ultrasound images and used the most effective sets of features to distinguish between normal cysts, ﬁbroid cysts, and ovarian cysts. Ovarian cysts are ﬂuid-ﬁlled pockets that can grow on or within the ovaries. These cysts can grow in a variety of shapes and sizes, with most ovarian cysts being characterized as benign and asymptomatic, disappearing without the need for medical intervention. However, in some cases, ovarian cysts can cause complications that require the interven- tion of health care providers. Additionally, on a preventative front, regular pelvic exams can help reduce a person’s chances of developing ovarian cysts. To facilitate the computer-aided analysis of ultrasound uterus images to identify and classify cysts, we propose the following code functions: – cleaning the memory; – initializing of matrices with the size of twenty samples expandable; – initializing the number of samples; – reading normal uterine samples; – reading infected uterine cyst samples; – ﬁnding the average core images of all uteruses; – normalizing the images by subtracting the mean from each image;"

The system is trained on labelled uterine images (normal, ﬁbroid, and ovarian cyst). During the testing phase, the performance of the system is assessed by entering a test image to compute the accuracy of the system’s decision. We used an (ANN) classiﬁer to distinguish between normal, ﬁbroid, and ovarian cyst. During the PCA modeling phase, 198 images were used, and we obtained mean and unit vectors (Ѱ & U).

Hospital readmission within 30 days of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) dis- charge remains a signiﬁcant challenge, linked to increased mortality and healthcare costs. We present BERTBoost, a novel hybrid machine learning framework that integrates structured electronic health record (EHR) variables (e.g., demographics, diagnoses, lab values) with semantic embeddings derived from discharge sum- maries using ClinicalBERT. The model was trained on the MIMIC-III dataset, with class imbalance addressed using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Tech- nique (SMOTE), and evaluated on a held-out test set. The ﬁnal cohort included 7,917 ICU stays, with approximately 30% experiencing a 30-day readmission. BERTBoost achieved 89.7% accuracy, 95.4% precision, 72.6% recall, an F1- score of 0.83, and a ROC–AUC of 0.922, outperforming structured-only base- lines (∼70% accuracy, AUC 0.75). The inclusion of unstructured text improved recall from 50% to 72.6%, representing a 46% relative gain over the structured- only XGBoost baseline, by capturing clinical context often missed by coded data.

Keywords: ClinicalBERT · Electronic Health Records · ICU Readmission · Machine Learning · Predictive Modeling 1 Introduction Hospital readmissions when an inpatient is readmitted within a few days of discharge are universally acknowledged as markers of poor quality of care and are associated with signiﬁcant ﬁnancial penalties for hospitals. Elevated rates of readmissions within 30 days have become a priority for healthcare providers and policymakers. In the US, ∼18% of Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in avoidable spending [ 1]. Beyond economics, readmitted patients have poorer outcomes: research has found considerably higher mortality rates among readmitted patients within a month in comparison with those who are not readmitted. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026 K.

However, most of these approaches rely solely on structured data, overlooking the wealth of information found in unstructured clinical notes. Discharge summaries, for instance, offer detailed accounts of hospital stay, patient condition, and post-discharge plans—details that are rarely captured in coded electronic health records (EHRs) [ 2, 5]. With recent progress in large language models (LLMs), especially those trained on medical text, it has become increasingly feasible to extract meaningful insights from nar- rative clinical data. Transformer-based models like ClinicalBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers pretrained on clinical text), trained on EHR notes, have shown strong performance in predicting clinical outcomes [ 6–9], thus enabling the integration of unstructured data into scalable predictive systems. At the same time, tree- based models like Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) have emerged as top choices for structured medical data, known for their accuracy, efﬁciency, and interpretability [ 10]. We believe that combining the semantic depth of ClinicalBERT embeddings with the robustness of XGBoost can produce a more comprehensive and accurate prediction model.

A BERTBoost Framework for Risk Stratiﬁcation of Intensive Care 171 2.1 Traditional Models and Early Clinical NLP Initially, most hospital readmission prediction efforts relied heavily on structured data like patient demographics, lab results and diagnoses. Futoma et al. [3] explored classical models such as logistic regression and decision trees, which often performed better than traditional clinical scoring systems. However, these models had a major limitation they could not fully capture the subtle narrative aspects of a patient’s health journey. To address this, researchers began including unstructured clinical notes (like dis- charge summaries) in their models. Moerschbacher and He [ 5], for example, used both structured and unstructured features from the MIMIC-III dataset and saw improved per- formance, even with a basic logistic regression model that achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.757. Still, the early methods for handling text such as bag-of-words and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) were quite primitive. They couldn’t capture meaning or context very well.

As highlighted by Xiao et al. [ 8], while unstructured data holds great potential, it also introduces new challenges for deep learning models in healthcare. 2.2 Rise of Transformers in Clinical NLP The introduction of transformer-based models marked a turning point in clinical natural language processing (NLP). These models brought a new level of understanding to unstructured text by capturing the context and semantics more effectively. One standout example is ClinicalBERT, introduced by Huang et al. [ 6], which was pre-trained on MIMIC-III discharge notes. It signiﬁcantly outperformed older NLP features and even long short-term memory (LSTM)-based models for predicting readmissions. Further expanding on this, Alsentzer et al. [9] made ClinicalBERT publicly available, trained on a wide range of EHR notes. This facilitated the adoption of such models in real-world healthcare tasks. By understanding language the way clinicians actually write, these models opened the door to much more accurate and meaningful predictions from text data. 2.3 Hybrid Models and Modern LLM Integration Blending structured data with unstructured clinical notes has shown strong predic- tive value.

Dafrallah and Akhlouﬁ [ 7] used gradient boosting with Biomedical BERT (BioBERT)-based named entity recognition (NER) features from discharge summaries, achieving 88% precision for unplanned readmissions. To maintain interpretability, others have applied regularization techniques such as the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selec- tion Operator (LASSO) and tree-based importance scoring [ 11]. More recently, LLMs like Clinical Prediction Large Language Model (CPLLM) [12], a GPT-style model, have demonstrated the ability to extract patterns across diverse clinical events from large-scale text. Our own approach, BERTBoost, follows this path. It brings together ClinicalBERT (for understanding clinical narratives) and XGBoost (for handling structured EHR fea- tures), aiming to offer the best of both worlds: deep semantic insight and transparent, efﬁcient predictions [ 10]. 172 K. Rathod et al. 3 Methodology 3.1 Data Source and Cohort Selection We utilized the MIMIC-III database [ 1], a publicly available critical care dataset com- prising over 40,000 ICU admissions from a single tertiary hospital (2001–2012), see Fig. 1.

BERTBoost merges structured EHR data with ClinicalBERT embeddings from discharge summaries, compresses the text via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and feeds it into XGBoost to predict 30-day ICU readmissions Each ICU admission record comprises structured ﬁelds (e.g., vitals, lab tests, ICD-9 codes) and unstructured clinical notes.

We limited our analysis to adult patients (≥18 years) who survived their hospital stay and considered only their ﬁrst ICU admission to avoid sample overlap. Patients who died in the hospital or were discharged to other acute care facilities were excluded, as they were not at risk of readmission. Additionally, we ﬁltered out planned. readmissions (e.g., scheduled procedures) to focus on preventable cases. The ﬁnal cohort included 7,917 ICU stays, with approximately 30% experiencing a 30-day readmission. We used an 80/20 patient-level train-test split, ensuring no overlap A BERTBoost Framework for Risk Stratiﬁcation of Intensive Care 173 across sets, and performed 5-fold cross-validation on the training set for model selection and tuning. 3.2 Feature Extraction and Preprocessing We extracted structured and unstructured features for each patient to capture their clinical state at the time of ICU discharge which serve as essential inputs for BERTBoost. The main structured are as follows: • Demographics: Age (capped at 89 for de-identiﬁcation) and gender. Age was used as both a continuous variable and categorical bins (18–40, 41–65, and 66+ years) in order to capture non-linear risk. • Comorbidities and Diagnoses: ICD-9 (International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 9th Revision) codes were translated into higher-level disease categories.

We calculated the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index [ 13] as an overall burden of chronic illness and the count of previous hospitalizations as an indicator of longitudinal risk. • Hospital Stay: Stay duration, utilization of critical interventions (such as mechanical ventilation and vasopressors), and discharge destination (such as home or a skilled facility) are each predictive of outcomes in the post-discharge period. • Laboratory Results and Vital Signs: We incorporated the latest laboratory values and vital signs (e.g., creatinine, haematocrit, heart rate, blood pressure) at discharge. We noted any abnormal values and trends for physiological stability. • Administrative and Utilization Factors: Admission type (elective vs. emergency) and primary payer type (Medicaid, Medicare, private) were coded according to previous literature identifying their association with readmission risk. Categorical variables were one-hot encoded, while the continuous variables were standardized. In the case of missing data, median imputation for continuous variables was applied, as well as adding a speciﬁc”missing” category for categorical ﬁelds. 3.3 Clinical Text Embedding with ClinicalBERT We employed ClinicalBERT [6]—a task-speciﬁc version of Bidirectional Encoder Rep- resentations from Transformers (BERT) pre-trained on MIMIC-III clinical notes—to embed discharge summaries.

To mitigate overﬁtting and reduce dimensionality, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to these ClinicalBERT embeddings. PCA projects the original high- dimensional data X ∈ R n ×d (where d = 768) into a lower-dimensional space by com- puting the principal components—directions of maximum variance. Mathematically, PCA seeks a projection matrix W ∈ R d × k such that: Z = X · W( 1 ) Where: • X is the matrix of input ClinicalBERT embeddings (one per patient). 174 K. Rathod et al. • W contains the top k eigenvectors of the covariance matrix Σ = (1/n) X (T) X, • Z ∈ Rn×k is the low-dimensional representation. These eigenvectors are computed by solving: wi = λiwi (2) where λi and wi are the eigenvalue and eigenvector. We retained the top 50 components (i.e., k = 50), which collectively explained approximately 85% of the total variance (with the ﬁrst component explaining ∼32%) [13]. These PCA-compressed vectors were then normalized and concatenated with the structured features to create the ﬁnal aggregated feature vector for each patient. This dimensionality reduction not only enhances the generalizability and efﬁciency of the downstream XGBoost model but also enables interpretability via analysis of textderived principal components (e.g., Text PC1, Text PC2)."

XGBoost is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds decision trees iteratively to minimize a regularized objective function, making it highly effective for tabular and heterogeneous data. Hyperparameter Tuning: We performed a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation to optimize key BERTBoost parameters, including tree depth, learning rate, boosting rounds, and L1/L2 penalties. The best conﬁguration—tree depth 5, learning rate 0.1, and ∼80 rounds was selected with early stopping (patience = 10) to prevent ove rﬁtting. Handling Class Imbalance: To address the ∼30% readmission rate, we applied Syn- thetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) on the training set to synthetically balance classes (∼1:1), enhancing model sensitivity. Comparable performance was also observed using XGBoost’s scale pos weight parameter. Baseline Models: To quantify the impact of the ClinicalBERT embeddings, we implemented two baselines: • Logistic Regression using only structured features. • XGBoost using only structured features.

Table 1 presents a comparison with baseline models. • Accuracy: 89.7%, outperforming baselines (∼70%). • Recall: 72.6%, capturing most high-risk cases (vs. ∼50% in baselines). • Precision: 95.4%, indicating few false alarms. • F1-score: 0.83, vs. ∼0.56–0.57 in baselines. • ROC-AUC: 0.92, showing excellent class separation. These results conﬁrm that the integration of ClinicalBERT embeddings enhances recall and discrimination. The model assigned higher risk scores to readmitted than non-readmitted patients in over 92% of cases, demonstrating strong class discrimination.

XGBoost provided importance scores based on each feature’s contribution to reducing error [10]. Top predictors included both structured variables and ClinicalBERT-derived components, offering insight into the model’s decision-making process. As expected, age was a strong predictor—older patients were more likely to experi- ence readmission, consistent with clinical literature [ 5, 11].

For instance, Text PC1 correlated with note length and complexity, often reﬂecting detailed follow-up plans or complications, and was linked to higher readmission risk [ 6, 7]. Length of stay (LOS) was another key factor, with longer hospitalizations often indicating greater post-discharge vulnerability [ 2, 9]. In contrast, gender had minimal inﬂuence, consistent with its limited predictive value in prior studies [ 11]. 178 K. Rathod et al.

Despite strong performance, some challenges remain: components like Text PC1 and Text PC2 are inﬂuential but abstract. Our analysis suggests they reﬂect aspects like narrative detail or discharge complexity. Tools such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and atten- tion maps may help clarify these dimensions and enhance interpretability and clinician trust [ 11]. Practically, BERTBoost offers advantages over deep neural networks faster training, lower computational demand, and built-in interpretability via XGBoost feature scores [5, 10]. Its stable training and validation performance (Fig. 2), aided by regularization and PCA-based embedding reduction, indicate strong generalization without overﬁtting [6, 10]. 4.6 Generalizability and Limitations BERTBoost was trained and validated on the MIMIC-III dataset, which—despite its detailed ICU records—is limited to a single hospital setting [ 1]. To improve general- izability, future studies should test the model on MIMIC-IV or multi-center datasets [ 14]. A key limitation is that MIMIC-III lacks data on readmissions to external hospitals, which may lead to underreported outcomes.

Finally, predictions were made at discharge using ﬁnalized summaries. Future work could explore earlier predictions during hospitalization by incorporating dynamic data such as vital signs and progress notes [ 10, 15, 16]. 4.7 Deployment Considerations BERTBoost is designed for clinical integration. Once a discharge summary is ﬁnalized, ClinicalBERT embeddings can be rapidly generated with Graphics Processing Units A BERTBoost Framework for Risk Stratiﬁcation of Intensive Care 179 (GPUs), and XGBoost computes real-time risk scores. This enables timely follow-ups or medication reviews [ 6]. Alert thresholds can be tailored to hospital needs—favoring recall or precision as appropriate (Fig. 4) [17]. Despite using an LLM, the framework remains lightweight at inference. Further optimization via quantization or distillation could support deployment in low-resource settings [ 6]. 5 Summary and Conclusion We have developed BERTBoost, a multimodal framework that combines structured EHR data with ClinicalBERT-derived discharge summaries to predict 30-day ICU readmissions.

It delivered strong performance across recall, precision, and AUC by capturing both traditional risk factors (e.g., age, comorbidities, length of stay) and contextual informa- tion from narrative summaries. Notably, it remained interpretable and computationally efﬁcient, without requiring language model ﬁne-tuning. However, limitations remain: the model was trained on a single-center dataset, employed a frozen encoder, and generated predictions only at discharge factors that may hinder generalizability and earlier intervention. Future work will focus on: • Interpretability Enhancements: Applying SHAP for XGBoost and attention visual- ization techniques for ClinicalBERT components to better explain model decisions and increase clinician trust. • Scalability and Deployment: Exploring model compression techniques like distil- lation or quantization to facilitate real-time deployment in hospital systems with minimal resource requirements.

AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) redeﬁnes cloud computing by enabling scal- able and autonomous AI-based solutions. Optimizing AI workloads on heteroge- neous infrastructure for the multi-cloud context is challenging because of perfor- mance heterogeneity, management of resources, and cost. Experimental perfor- mance evaluation for the performance of AIaaS in the context of the multi-cloud environment is presented in this paper with the MLPerf Benchmarks Dataset. Google Cloud’s TPU v4 offers the highest throughput at 60 TFLOPS but at the highest cost per execution at $0.40, while AWS balances cost and performance at 45 TFLOPS at $0.35 per execution. Azure offers the lowest cost at $0.30, but the lowest throughput at 38 TFOPs. A workload balancing strategy for the multi-cloud context improves performance by 15% and cost savings by 12%, demonstrating the possibility for AI-optimized AIaaS deployment.

With organizations leveraging AI-based solutions more than ever, the demand for scalable, ﬂexible, and efﬁcient AIaaS platforms has grown manifold. Multi-cloud computing, which involves using multiple cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.), is now the preferred strategy for optimizing AI workloads [ 1, 2]. However, deploying AI workloads in multiple cloud providers is fraught with performance inconsistency, inefﬁcient workload distribution, cost variations, and latency. Although cloud-based AI solutions have come a long way, seamless AI workload orchestration in the multi-cloud environment is an ongoing challenge. This research seeks to investigate the performance of AIaaS on different cloud providers using the MLPerf Benchmarks Dataset to improve AI-based workload optimization methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026 K.

V adisetty This paper’s motivation comes from the varying performance and cost disparities when executing AI models in multi-cloud environments. While cloud vendors offer opti- mized hardware (GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs) for AI workloads, the efﬁciency of running AI models can be highly dependent on infrastructure conﬁgurations. Most research only looks at one cloud vendor, with little research having been performed to compare the per- formance of AI workloads across different cloud platforms. The core research question in this paper is:  Do AI workloads on cloud providers exhibit different performances in latency, computational performance, and cost? When responding to this question, we try to provide empirical evidence to aid orga- nizations in making informed choices regarding deploying AI models in multi-cloud settings. This paper contributes the following to the literature:  End-to-end Performance Evaluation – We benchmark the performance of AI models on AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure against MLPerf metrics for latency, throughput, and cost.  AI-Driven Optimization Strategies – We explore intelligent workload distribution techniques to improve AIaaS efﬁciency in multi-cloud environments.  Insights for AI Deployment through Empirical Observations – Our work pro- vides real-world insight into cloud heterogeneity and its inﬂuence on AI model performance."

Multiple studies have focused on the potential of AIaaS and scalability, efﬁciency, and deployment in cloud-based settings.

Studies have revealed that performance in implementing AI mod- els can be highly variable with the cloud provider due to variations in accelerators, virtualization technologies, and network latency. Organizations are increasingly adopting multi-cloud computing to reduce vendor lock-in and improve redundancy. Multi-cloud deployment research points to the advan- tage of having workloads spread across multiple providers for greater resilience and efﬁciency. However, performance heterogeneity is a serious concern. Organizations like Spotify have adopted multi-cloud methods in production environments to avoid depen- dency on one provider [ 5, 6]. It has been shown that banks use latency-sensitive AI workloads such as real-time fraud detection to degrade performance when executed across multiple clouds due to network overhead and cross-cloud data transfer limits [ 7, 8]. The MLPerf benchmarking suite has gained widespread use to benchmark the per- formance of AI workloads in cloud environments. Research work used MLPerf datasets to benchmark the efﬁciency of runs for AI models on GPUs and TPUs. Research has established that TPUs on Google Cloud are more efﬁcient than traditional GPUs for deep learning workloads, but are not always cost-effective for light workloads. Similarly, the"

Similarly, the Inferentia chips by AWS have shown potential for inference workloads but are yet to be embraced due to compatibility problems with standard AI frameworks. Such ﬁndings indicate that cloud AI infrastructure is advancing, but no provider yet offers an ideal solution for all AI workloads, necessitating a thorough comparison across platforms [ 9]. 2.2 Critical Analysis Although the literature provides valuable information regarding the performance of AIaaS, most of the work addresses isolated cloud environments and not multi-cloud conﬁgurations. The most prominent limitation in the literature is the lack of end-to- end comparison across cloud providers for deploying AI models. Although some work addresses cost-performance trade-offs, it uses theoretical cost models and does not utilize real-world benchmarks. This leaves the literature with a knowledge gap regarding the performance of AI workloads in real-world multi-cloud conﬁgurations, where the avail- ability of spot instances and price differences across regions highly impact deployment efﬁciency [ 10, 11]. Another major constraint is the insufﬁcient research into AI-based workload orches- tration methods for multi-clouds.

Research has identiﬁed the inefﬁciencies in manual workload assignment, but little work explores the utilization of AI for optimizing AIaaS execution on cloud platforms. Moreover, network latency and inter-cloud communi- cation bottlenecks have also been identiﬁed as serious issues, but little work provides concrete techniques to handle such problems. In real-world applications, organizations like Uber have experienced latency in AI-based demand forecasting when transferring workloads across clouds, demonstrating the need for optimized scheduling [ 12]. Security and compliance are also signiﬁcant concerns with multi-cloud AIaaS imple- mentations. Some research touches on the risks of transferring information between cloud providers, particularly in highly regulated industries such as healthcare and ﬁnance.

It explores intelligent orchestration techniques for maximiz- ing the efﬁciency of AI model execution. Lastly, this paper analyzes network perfor- mance issues in multi-cloud AIaaS settings and evaluates the feasibility of AI-based performance optimization methods to address inter-cloud delay issues.

The algorithm was deployed using Python and utilized the pre-scheduling logic based on rules to assign AI jobs—training, inference, and data preprocessing—to bins based on latency, throughput, and cost sensitivity. Real-time inference jobs, for example, were tagged as latency-sensitive and were preferentially deployed to the Google Cloud, the cloud provider with the least latency. In contrast, training jobs that extended to lengthy periods were forwarded to the best throughput-to-cost providers (e.g., AWS). Reinforcement learning, speciﬁcally a variant of Q-learning, was utilized to update the best decisions to be deployed dynamically by adding fresh performance and cost information into the environment. With time, the algorithm became attuned to prefer deployments that yielded the best aggregate performance depending on the type of job to be run and the resource availability.

Secondly, static allocation was attempted where percentages of the work- loads were statically allocated between the providers, regardless of live performance statistics. Thirdly, the dynamic balancing algorithm was executed, which allowed the real-time workloads to be distributed based on live statistics and the algorithm’s learned optimization patterns. Latency, performance, and cost savings were measured compared to the baseline. Self-balancing multi-cloud deployment reduced average latency to 100 ms (from the 120 ms AWS baseline, the 135 ms Azure baseline) while improving aggregate through- put by 15% and reducing costs by 12%. These ﬁgures were extracted using self- contained automatic monitor scripts inside the workload containers, which fed real-time performance traces to a centralized logging management console to be analyzed. Among the design innovations was that it could use real-time pricing information (by calls to simulated price engines via APIs) and even adjust to availability restrictions, i.e., the speciﬁc instance sizes not being accessible due to the movement of the spot market or quota restrictions that exist.

AI models are also considered the same across platforms, even with minor variations in underlying infrastructure optimizations. Despite the strict method, certain constraints must be kept in mind. Three major cloud providers are only considered in the research, and other cloud platforms, such as IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud, which can have different AIaaS capabilities, are excluded. Performance results depend on cloud infrastructure availability in various regions, so the outcome can differ depending on the deployment geographies. Fixed AI workloads are the target for the benchmarking method, which can restrict generalizability to custom AI models with speciﬁc computational needs.

Security and compliance concerns also become risk factors when it comes to the deployment of AI models in the multi-cloud scenario.

Security integration across many providers is a big challenge, particularly for industries dealing with sensitive information, such as healthcare, ﬁnance, and government. The ﬁnal challenge is AI workload orchestration and automation. Clever AI-based orchestration techniques are required to optimize workloads on multiple cloud platforms.

Though generic metrics such as TFLOPS and latency indicate compute power, more distinguishing metrics such as inference through- put, power efﬁciency, and model training time are responsible for measuring the per- formance of AI as a Service (AIaaS). Google Cloud TPUs boasted the highest raw per- formance at 60 TFLOPS, followed closely by the AWS Inferentia chips at 45 TFLOPS, then Microsoft Azure GPUs at 38 TFLOPS. Nevertheless, Google Cloud’s average price per execution run was $0.40 compared to AWS at $0.35 and Azure at $0.30. Besides, whereas Google experienced the best latency at 95ms, AWS experienced higher infer- ence throughput with up to 20,000 at the base NLP models, compared to Google at 17,500, and then Azure at 15,800.

This is extremely valuable for those companies that want to expand AI capa- bilities without contributing to the carbon footprint and energy level consumed. Time to complete model training is another important measure, particularly for industries based on continuous learning. Training for large-scale BERT train jobs took AWS 2.5 h, Google 2.2 h, and Azure 2.8 h. Google had the fastest train time, but the more expensive price and signiﬁcant power consumption negated some of the advantage. These additional metrics provide a more accurate basis for judging platforms against one another. The hybrid approach to cloud deployment piloted in the trial further underscored the feasibility of an integrated approach.

These ﬁndings are particularly suitable for AI-hungry sectors. Autonomous driving platforms, for example, call for high inference throughput and low latency to respond to real-time needs, which Google’s TPUs and AWS Inferentia are suitable for under the hybrid strategy. AI applications of medicine that call for quicker training of diagnostic models can be well served by Google’s improved training acceleration. In contrast, ﬁnancial applications that deliver incessant fraud detection processing may favor AWS to realize power-efﬁcient throughput and lower operating costs.

Each cloud platform—AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure—possesses unique security models, identity and access management (IAM) prac- tices, and encryption standards. The difference creates inconsistency in enforcing uni- form data protection strategies. For instance, while a user might have a default end-to-end encryption from one provider, another provider might need manual conﬁguration for the same level. This inconsistency forms the security silos that are hard to bridge, particu- larly when data is being shared or transmitted between cloud environments. Since AI workloads often concern sensitive datasets, like medical records, ﬁnancial information, or user behavior logs, inconsistent security baselines might leave the system vulnerable to breaches or non-compliance events. 192 R.

In the absence of a centralized governance layer that enforces standardized logging, encryption, and access control, data sovereignty risks are exponentially ampliﬁed. Another pressing issue is security tool interoperability and incident response frag- mentation. With AI workloads cross-providing, detection, reporting, and mitigation of security incidents are siloed across multiple dashboards and monitoring platforms. Such integration gaps can impede response times for potential breaches or anomalies.

The interesting revelation that workload distri- bution across several clouds by 12% lowered costs shows that intelligent distribution of workloads with AI can make it more efﬁcient without trading off performance [ 12, 13]. This suggests the shift from selecting one provider to using a multi-cloud optimizing strategy, with the workloads for AI being assigned dynamically based on real-time cost and performance. One possible explanation for these results is that cloud-speciﬁc AI accelerators, such as Google TPUs, provide increased efﬁciency for speciﬁc workloads but do not always justify the cost premium for every workload.

A second surprising result is that latency optimizations in the multi-cloud scenario were less pronounced than expected, possibly because of inter-cloud network transfer latency [ 13]. This shows that while workload balancing maximizes cost and performance, it does not entirely negate the network limits for multi-cloud AI deployment. These ﬁndings suggest the need for further Agent AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) in Multi-Cloud Environments 193 optimizing AIaaS workload distribution methods, particularly the utilization of real-time price models, adaptive scheduling, and network-aware workload distribution. Follow- up work can build on these ﬁndings by considering machine learning-based workload forecasting models that adapt AIaaS deployment dynamically to cost ﬂuctuations and performance trends.

In modern life, the artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) starting to play an increas- ingly signiﬁcant role, its subsequent integration into higher education institutions (HEIs) has become an important component of digital transformation. While AI demonstrates the huge potential to improve the effectiveness in both teaching and administrative operations, its adoption has not been uniform across all institutions. In regions with lower levels of digital literacy and underdeveloped infrastructure- particularly in remote areas- AI is not yet being used effectively or consistently. These disparities make it essential to examine how educators are using AI and what challenges they face, in order to inform more inclusive and effective digi- tal transition policies.

The survey involved 492 respondents (educators) from 13 institutions of various ages and experience levels and was conducted via the Qualtrix platform. The survey assessed digital readiness, familiarity with AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT), frequency of use, inﬂuencing factors, perceived beneﬁts, and challenges encoun- tered. Descriptive analysis revealed that approximately 40% of respondents use AI frequently or daily, while 17.9% are not familiar with AI tools. A statistically sig- niﬁcant relationship was found between age and AI usage, with younger academic staff showing higher familiarity and more frequent use. This research is directed to uncover the present Aİ adoption situation in Azerbaijan regional universities and shows key areas for targeted interventions.

Subsequently, HEIs must develop robust frameworks that ensue the alignment od AI technologies with core academic principles, that emphasize critical thinking, originality and social responsibility. The adoption of AI being a widespread technological trend is also a transfor- mative force demanding an interdisciplinary and value-driven institutional reaction. In the context of rapid digitalization investments in faculty training, ethical gover- nance frameworks, and redundant technical infrastructure are important to preserve the human-centric values of higher education. 1.1 Problem Statement Several authors highlighted the application of AI tools for various purposes in HEIs processes such as grading, intelligent tutoring, and data-supported feedback mechanisms [ 4, 5]. These advantages at the same time bring out concerns on academic integrity, algorithmic bias, and disruption of critical thinking skills [ 6, 7]. For this particular reason European Commission (2019) has recognized the requirements for AI tools in education processes to be lawful, ethical and socially sustainable [ 8].

Furthermore, the lack of proper solutions on AI governance, academic freedom, and human agency in decision-making [ 2, 8] hinder the AI adoption process. HEIs risk falling behind in technological progress without context-sensitive and ethical grounded policies. In other scenario universities integrate AI that compromise their educational missions lacking related frameworks in place. 1.2 Research Objectives This research aims to contribute to the increasing literature on AI adoption in HEIs, particularly focusing on the regional university faculty readiness in under-resourced context.

This tendency highly correlates with introduction of generative AI tools as ChatGPT. Researchers have tackled the topic from variety of context, such as ped- agogical innovation, ethical responsibility, faculty preparedness, and learner-instructor relations. Though major body of literature accepts the transformative contribution of AI, at the time within unregulated or uncritical terms it creates various risks and restrictions.

They distinguished the most popular uses of technology, such as academic writing and tutoring support, auto- mated assessment, but they also highlighted persisting ethical and regulatory concerns. A primary contribution of their research is a set of practical guidelines for responsible usage that prioritize honesty, critical interaction, and educator supervision. Additionally, they claimed that to prohibit these tools are ineffective and pointless, and instead encourage ﬂexibible institutional policies that embrace AI’s presence in academic settings.

Their research reveals the concern that although HEIs are interested in AI ethics, its actual implementation in higher education curriculum remains mostly inconsistent and partial. The researchers consistently emphasize the necessity of integration of ethical requirements across educational processes to provide graduates with not only technological literacy, but also social responsibility while using AI. The AI inﬂuence on educational processes especially relationships between students and instructors has been the focus area for many researchers as well. Seo et al. (2021) investigate the effect of using AI tools on communication, support, and engagement in online learning context. They came into conclusion that Ai on the one hand, can improve efﬁciency and availability, on the other hand, it can hinder the human participation in teaching and learning. As an example, they mentioned reduced interaction and sense of human elements resulted from usage of AI tutors or automated assessment tools. The authors highlight the importance of maintaining a “human-in-the-loop” design philos- ophy to ensure that AI tools supplement rather than replace meaningful engagement between educators and learners."

A broader review of the state of AI in higher education is offered by [ 5], who con- ducted a systematic analysis of 138 peer-reviewed articles published between 2016 and 2022. Their ﬁndings indicate a rapid increase in AI-related publications, especially in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic. The study identiﬁes ﬁve primary uses of AI: assessment and evaluation, predictive analytics, AI assistants, intelligent tutoring 198 U. Isfandiyarova et al. systems, and student learning management. Notably, 72% of the studies focused on stu- dents, with only 17% addressing instructors. This imbalance suggests that while student- centered applications are ﬂourishing, there is less emphasis on faculty development and institutional capacity-building- a critical gap in the literature. What emerges across these studies is a consensus on the urgent need for struc- tured institutional responses to AI integration through ethical frameworks, pedagogical guidelines, or faculty training programs. The literature points to a collective recognition that, AI is not a temporary trend but a permanent feature of the educational landscape. However, there remains a signiﬁcant disparity in how institutions—particularly those in regional or under-resourced contexts are equipped to respond to this shift. The lack of uniform policy, infrastructure, and expertise may hinder equitable access to AI’s beneﬁts, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities in higher education."

In summary, while the literature presents a rich and evolving discussion on AI in higher education, it also highlights areas that require further exploration. These include localized studies on faculty readiness, the long-term impact on student learning behav- iors, and the development of scalable models for ethical AI integration. By addressing these gaps, future research can contribute to a more inclusive and sustainable digital transformation of education. While existing scholarship provides valuable insights into the pedagogical, ethical, and institutional dimensions of AI in higher education, much of it remains concentrated on technologically advanced or well-resourced institutions. There is comparatively lim- ited empirical research examining how faculty members in regional or underfunded universities perceive and engage with AI tools. This study seeks to address that gap by investigating digital readiness, usage patterns, and perceived barriers among academic staff in a regional context.

This highlights the need for a more systematic approach to AI adoption that goes beyond casual or isolated use. The study also identiﬁed age as a signiﬁcant factor in AI adoption, with younger faculty members showing a higher frequency of AI usage. This supports ﬁndings from [ 15], who discussed that younger digitally literate faculty are the more open to integrate new technologies. This suggests that the generational shift in teaching staff is likely to inﬂuence the future landscape of AI integration in higher education. However, the research found no obvious variances in AI tools usage on gender or regional HEIs context, that being unexpected that other researchers conﬁrmed gender- based differences in technology usage [ 7]. This situation may indicate two possible scenarios: regional HEIs provide equal levels of digital exposure to all educators, or AI readiness is equally low across genders and institutions.

Institutional Support: One of the key shortcomings identiﬁed is the lack of institutional support mechanisms for AI adoption in regional universities. While some awareness exists, there is insufﬁcient infrastructure, training, and access to AI tools that can enable faculty members to integrate these technologies into their teaching effectively. Ethical Concerns: Faculty members expressed signiﬁcant concerns about the ethical implications of AI usage, particularly regarding plagiarism and the potential for students to misuse AI tools [17–22]. This highlights a need for clear ethical guidelines and training on responsible AI use to ensure that AI enhances, rather than undermines, academic integrity. Access to Tools: The limited access to high-quality AI tools remains a signiﬁcant barrier.

This study explores the use of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and edge computing to improve the performance of cloud-native AI applications. Tradi- tional cloud-based AI suffers from latency and a reliance on centralized resources, which hinders its viability and effectiveness in real-time systems and resource- constrained systems, including Internet of Things (IoT) systems, autonomous vehi- cles, and smart cities. The major problem being addressed is that traditional cloud infrastructure cannot provide the low-latency and high-efﬁciency necessary to run modern AI applications.

However, as businesses call for real- time data processing and instantaneous decision-making to satisfy customer demands and achieve ﬁnancial results, the drawbacks of cloud-mindfulness have become more apparent. Clouds will always suffer from challenges such as latency (high latency), vol- ume of data (increased bandwidth), always-on connection (intermittent connection), and long-distance (data privacy challenges) that will continue to inhibit cloud-based systems from responding to time-critical events [ 1, 2]. In response to the limitations above, edge computing has developed as an alternative to allow for computing to be performed near where the sensor data is being sourced from, processing on devices like IoT sensors, smartphones, or other embedded sys- tems, so that round-trip communication latency can be reduced as well as ofﬂoading the cloud infrastructure.

Edge computing sup- ports real-time responsiveness (critical for applications with immediate decision-making needs) [4]. 210 A. Polamarasetti et al. 2.2 AI Methods for Edge Computing A core challenge to the future of deploying edge AI is the resource constraints of edge devices. Typically, deep learning models require considerable compute, an unacceptable component for CPU, memory, and energy limitations found in edge-based hardware. The research community has developed lightweight AI models like MobileNet, Tiny-YOLO, and SqueezeNet, which are intended to approximate acceptable accuracy levels while signiﬁcantly reducing the amount of computing required [ 4, 5]. These models have been deployed successfully in various environments such as real-time object detection, video surveillance, and sensor data analytics, afﬁrming their potential for an actual deployable environment at the edge [ 4, 8]. 2.3 Challenges in AI at the Edge Edge deployment of AI poses several challenges. The most apparent is hardware limita- tion because edge devices typically have limited processing power, memory, and storage compared to cloud servers.

Federated learning addresses some of these challenges with decentralized training. Network problems also impact the operation of edge computing, particularly in remote or mobile deployments where the network may be weak or unstable [ 4, 5]. 2.4 Cloud-Native AI Applications The advent of cloud-native applications has given rise to architectures that leverage cloud computing’s scalability and elasticity and maximize the utilization of resources. Cloud- native AI applications are susceptible to latency and real-time processing problems. Edge computing solves these problems by shifting some of the computation to devices locally to deliver faster response time and reduce cloud infrastructure dependency [ 6, 7]. In autonomous vehicles, for example, mission-critical decision-making operations need to be carried out in real-time for safety, and edge computing provides the capability to make these decisions locally without waiting for cloud processing. 2.5 Related Work New advancements in edge computing have recently encouraged researchers to investi- gate its integration with AI to address the requirements of latency-sensitive and real-time applications.

AI-Powered Edge Computing: Enhancing Cloud-Native AI Applications 211 In the healthcare sector, AI-enabled edge devices are changing how we think about patient monitoring. Wearable devices can analyze lightweight AI algorithms on local infrastructure, such as a watch, using regional data, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature, thereby removing the need to transfer real-time data from the patient to any cloud infrastructure. AI-enabled edge devices can save bandwidth because such devices do not carry as much real-time data in a never-ending manner, and patient privacy is greatly improved, which is rare in sensitive medical conditions [ 9]. Additionally, research indicates that edge AI in wearables enables quicker alerts for abnormal and critical health conditions, which can facilitate faster engagement and improved patient outcomes, particularly in areas where resource availability is limited or when services are physical distant (remote) from the patient, such as when incoming patient’s home is"

Still, the services are provided to the patients in the community or at the patient’s point of care. Autonomous systems, especially in vehicles, are another area in which AI-powered edge computing is vital. The mobility industry is highly dependent on rapid processing of incoming sensor data, like LiDAR, radar, and camera data, to decide how to navigate in sometimes milliseconds. Cloud-based processing becomes nonsensical in this regard, considering latency and bandwidth constraints. Research has shown that in-vehicle edge processors can execute AI models for real-time object detection, lane detection, and hazard avoidance without external communications [ 10]. Not only does this advance vehicle safety, but it will also expand autonomy and robustness in transport systems in unpredictable environments. Though these studies validate the capacity of AI at the edge, they generally highlight application areas or single-model deployments. V ery few have evaluated multiple AI models in a consistent edge computing framework.

The research assesses edge states simulated by IoT devices and edge servers. This was controlled by deploying models using TensorFlow Lite and orchestrating them using a cloud-native tool, Kubernetes. From there, an identical path and preprocessing pipeline were applied to the IoT-2 dataset containing environmental sensor data across all models. Each model was trained on a local node (registering the edge device), and real-time prediction efﬁciency was assessed using latency, CPU usage, memory usage, and model accuracy. Compared to existing literature, the unique aspect of this approach is the multi-model performance benchmarking in the same edge states, which has been otherwise lacking 212 A.

The dataset offered sensor data with temperature, humidity, and light fea- tures collected from sensors installed in real-world environments. The IoT-2 dataset was appropriate for edge computing and AI deployment because it offered time series and standard data for edge applications such as environmental monitoring, smart homes, and industrial IoT.

For MobileNet, depth multiplier and resolution were altered to lessen the burden on computational workload while still achieving a reasonable level of accuracy. The depth multiplier was set at 0.5, and the input resolution was ﬁxed at 160 × 160 to maximize running on the most constrained devices with memory and CPU resources [ 1]. Tiny-YOLO conﬁgurations took the standard compact variant, but with fewer convolutional layers and fewer ﬁlters to allow real-time detection on tight edge devices. A decision tree, for example, we set the maximum depth at 10 and the minimum samples per leaf at 5 to help achieve good generalization with acceptable resources. For federated learning, we set the number of communication rounds at 50 and a learning rate of 0.01, and followed a consistent approach with rates shown in benchmarks for distributed learning systems [ 2].

AI-Powered Edge Computing: Enhancing Cloud-Native AI Applications 213 3.4 Edge Computing Environment Installing a mix of edge servers and IoT devices simulated the edge computing setup. Temperature sensors, motion sensors, and smart cameras were used to create and process real-time data. Edge servers were used to simulate setups with higher computational capacities to allow more sophisticated AI models to be installed and compared with the IoT devices. This was useful in checking AI models’ resource consumption and scalability on different edge devices [ 12]. 3.5 Experimental Design The testbed included several steps: data preprocessing, model training, and testing. The IoT-2 dataset was preprocessed to remove noise and normalize the sensor readings. Several AI models were trained using preprocessed data, where real-time prediction was interesting. Models were tested regarding accuracy, latency, and resource consumption (CPU, memory, and bandwidth usage). Performance benchmarks were also designed to compare edge-based with traditional cloud-based solutions regarding efﬁciency and scalability. 3.6 Tools and Platforms The tools and platforms to host the edge AI applications included hosting AI models on edge devices using TensorFlow Lite.

Further, much of the existing research examines models’ performances on their own or discusses the merits of models theoretically. In contrast, this study provides empirical performance comparisons of four different AI approaches that utilize the same datasets and hardware simulations. Moreover, the current study provides all the AI performance comparisons in a federated learning setting. It is also novel as it considers privacy preservation in evaluating edge AI models, an underexplored element of most previous research. These methodical comparisons guide practitioners and system designers who select AI models to deploy to the Edge. This study ultimately contributes to future research by providing evidence on the performance trade-offs of selected AI models when operated in real-world conditions. 214 A.

Table 1 shows the performance of various AI models, where MobileNet offered the highest accuracy of 92%, which makes it the best suited for accuracy-focused tasks. The second-best performer was Federated Learning, with 90%, but it also registered the highest response time at 250 ms since decentralized learning would take longer. Tiny-YOLO was the quickest for speed, with a response time of 120 ms, which is best suited for real-time applications such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance. Tiny-YOLO was, however, less accurate (88%) than MobileNet. The Decision Tree model was the least accurate (85%) with a response time of 200 ms, which conﬁrms that while it is less computationally costly, it may not be the best suited for low-latency and high-accuracy applications.

This ﬁgure indicates that Tiny-YOLO has the smallest response time. Thus, it is best for latency-critical applications, and Federated Learning has the most signiﬁcant response time because it is decentralized. 4.2 Resource Utilization The resource consumption of edge and cloud deployments was compared in Table 2, reﬂecting the difference in CPU and memory consumption between cloud and edge environments. MobileNet and Decision Tree were the most CPU and memory resource- intensive at the edge (30% and 35% CPU, 45 MB and 55 MB memory, respectively) and were optimal for the resource-constrained environment. Tiny-YOLO consumed 40% of the CPU and 60 MB of memory, while Federated Learning consumed the least resources with 25% of the CPU and 40 MB of memory. Compared to cloud deployments, which consumed more resources for each model, the edge environment was signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient, as reﬂected in Table 2.

The faster response time of models like Tiny- YOLO directly means faster systems, which, when used like autonomous vehicles, are critical for safety, where speed of decision is vital. As great as it had the advantages of privacy and efﬁciency, Federated Learning had a more signiﬁcant latency, which would limit its usability in real-time systems. Data processing locally in edge devices reduces latency signiﬁcantly and improves scalability since devices can process and decide independently without cloud computing, thus alleviating resources from central systems. 4.3 Discussion MobileNet achieved the highest accuracy at 92%, indicating that it is best for edge deployments where the prediction quality is stressed. However, to achieve this accuracy, it has an average latency of 150 ms, indicating that it is less suited to ultra-prescriptive time tasks. Tiny-YOLO was the fastest model for latency at 120 ms, and therefore 216 A. Polamarasetti et al. is more valuable for real-time object detection applications. However, trade-offs are involved since its accuracy was lower (88%).

Y et, its average response time was 250 ms, limiting its implementation mainly to applications where privacy safeguards predominate, e.g., healthcare and ﬁnancial applications. The decision tree model had the simplest and lightest architecture, but returned the lowest accuracy of 85%, evidencing the trade-off between computational simplicity and predictive capacity. None of the ﬁndings indicate that there is now only the ‘best’ model that will serve for all edge applications, models must be selected on an application basis based on requirements such as speed, accuracy, or even privacy. Similarly to previous results, we also ﬁnd that edge deployments were on average more resource-efﬁcient than cloud deployments. Indeed, all models employed less CPU (20%–30%) and less memory (up to 40 MB) in the edge environment (compared to the cloud) on average across all scenarios. In short, our ﬁndings reinforce the conclusion that edge computing is feasible and even preferred for many practical use cases when we compare it to its cloud deployments. 4.4 Insights and Implications The study depicted some of the most signiﬁcant beneﬁts of AI-based edge computing.

Furthermore, edge computing reduces bandwidth consumption by reduc- ing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud. Not only do the operations become more efﬁcient, but data transfer is also made less expensive. Additionally, local processing of personal data enhances privacy because it does not necessitate the movement of sensi- tive personal data beyond the edge device. Finally, the effectiveness of edge resources makes scalable AI possible in IoT and imaginative city scenarios where multiple edge devices can operate independently but be part of a distributed, more extensive system. The results imply that edge computing and AI can signiﬁcantly affect performance, privacy, and resource efﬁciency in cloud-native AI applications. 5 Summary and Conclusion The study examined the intersection of AI and edge computing to enhance the perfor- mance of cloud-native AI applications. The most signiﬁcant ﬁndings were the dramat- ically reduced response time with AI models being executed on edge devices, where models like Tiny-YOLO gave the best response time. The study further found that MobileNet and Federated Learning yielded an acceptable balance between accuracy and resource usage, where Federated Learning was isolated as having minimal resource usage.

The results reveal a growing critical awareness of AI’s constraints, with respondents largely viewing it as a supplementary tool to enhance, rather than replace, traditional human-centered methods of interpretation and literary creation. AI offers valuable tools that can enhance literary studies, complementing human creativity and insight. While it excels at analysis, the unique ability of literature to explore the irrational and metaphysical aspects of human experience remains a domain where human intuition and subjectivity are irreplaceable. AI should therefore be viewed as a powerful supplement to, rather than a replacement for human-centered approaches in literary interpretation and creation.

This discussion has been at the center of literary studies, especially in the ﬁeld of literary theory, culminating with Harold Bloom’s book The Anxiety of Inﬂuence, in which originality is considered as a “poetic misprision” a misreading of predecessors that transforms their work into some- thing autonomous and entirely new [1]. Bloom, by emphasizing change and the need for innovation as an afﬁrmation of literary value, also considers it as a criterion of canoniza- tion. The fundamental feature of literary creation is the ability to renew and reinterpret the past, which until today has been a capacity deeply linked to human intelligence and intuition.

This article seeks to examine the extent to which AI-generated analyses and interpretations can meet the standards of originality traditionally upheld in literary studies. Meanwhile, as the ﬁeld of literary studies begins to interact with the tools of Artiﬁcial Intelligence, the issue of originality becomes even more pressing. While on the one hand AI has made important advances in literary analysis, which include, for example, the recognition of recurring linguistic, stylistic, and textual patterns, or thematic mapping; on the other hand, its use is limited since AI tools operate within the parameters of the data that feed them. The data that is already known can serve for analyses and research of a genre-based nature, without challenging the expectations and accepted deﬁnitions in the ﬁeld of literary studies. As Harold Bloom and other scholars observe, creation and originality are not merely about combining existing knowledge, but about the generation of something new that surpasses what has been previously known, while still ﬂowing from it. Change, after all, implies a reaction to pre-existing dominant literary forms. Nevertheless, until today we have read and studied the canon, but none of us has been able to read the entire literary corpus ever written [ 2].

Despite this potential, a clear research gap remains in understanding how AI inter- sects with the human creative process in literary scholarship. Existing studies tend to focus on technical capabilities such as pattern recognition without fully addressing the qualitative dimensions of literary originality. This study aims to ﬁll that gap by critically assessing the epistemological and theoretical implications of integrating AI into the core practices of literary analysis. Since AI relies on the combination of pre-existing data, the possibility for innovation and truly original research is limited. The ability of literature to challenge the boundaries of the known and to shape worldviews continues to occupy a space where the new, the irrational, and the unarticulated are born in forms that cannot be replicated by a non- human intelligence. Nevertheless, this principle is connected to an initial stage in the development of AI, and studies in this ﬁeld will continue to deepen and develop further as human intelligence interacts increasingly with artiﬁcial intelligence across all areas of activity.

Concurrently, the qualitative component utilizes interpretive analysis methods to explore deeper the- matic and epistemological questions arising from the integration of AI in the humanities, especially literary criticism. To achieve this, the study applies the analysis-synthesis method for a systematic thematic exploration of literary works. This process begins with an examination of established literary theories, aesthetics, and creative principles, allowing for a nuanced understanding of how AI intersects with traditional humanistic inquiry. The qualitative analysis is further enriched through an epistemological framework and subtextual analy- sis, which help address the metaphysical and irrational dimensions of literary art—areas where AI’s capabilities are inherently limited. Moreover, the methodology incorporates a forward-looking perspective that evalu- ates AI’s potential to democratize access to literary studies and foster a more inclusive, interdisciplinary academic environment.

This integrated approach aligns with the article’s objective to highlight the synergy between human creativity, emotional involve- ment, and AI’s analytical power, thereby advancing the boundaries of literary studies in the age of digital technology. 3 Originality in Literary Studies: Beyond the Known Creation as an act, particularly in artistic literature, often implies a departure from prede- termined norms that have been transformed into canon, by producing something entirely new, thus challenging the canon and seeking its own place within it. The meaning that H. Bergson attributes to the act of creation in Creative Evolution emphasizes that innovation is the act of transcending repetition, by presenting ideas that have neither been previ- ously articulated nor imagined [ 3]. This ability for innovation, the creation of something wholly novel, is essential regarding literary studies. The space created by literature, as a sphere of human activity wherein the irrational and transcendent intertwine, unfolds in entirely unique and often spontaneous ways that neither science nor technology can replicate."

Although 222 B. Ziﬂa and M. B. Halili the latter is not recommended nor valid for scientiﬁc research, since texts generated through artiﬁcial intelligence can also be detected by programs that utilize AI and rec- ognize AI’s “writing patterns” through non-human syntactical and idiosyncratic usages [5]. Nevertheless, what remains is that AI, in its essence, cannot transcend its program- ming to generate truly innovative ideas. Even though AI may assist us in identifying trends within literary historiography and mapping thematic and literary motif develop- ments, it cannot perform the necessary epistemological leap to produce new, original content. This also extends to the perspective of the language of literature, which is the literary instrument through which a work is constructed. As such, it is not merely form but encompasses the entire complexity of the literary work, including its content.

This means that, for works for which data exists, AI can perform excellent analyses by combining abundant information; however, it lacks this ability for works for which there is no available data, and the comments it generates on such works (at this stage of its development) are at a mediocre and excessively schematic level. The unique contribution of literature arises from the interaction between the inﬁ- nite dimensions of human experience and imagination, the unconscious, the dreamlike, and the metaphysical [ 8]. These realms remain unknown to Artiﬁcial Intelligence sys- tems, in the sense of exploration and personal experience. Literature often explores the metaphysical dimension, the unknown, or transcendence, where meanings are not easily decoded or understood by the reader. The metaphysical aspect represents a true challenge for AI, which relies on well- structured data and operates through logical procedures. Jung emphasizes that creative ability does not arise from profound intellectual reasoning, but from deeper, sometimes unconscious instincts. “The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intel- lect but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity.

We doubt that non-human intelligence can engage in such intuitive and symbolic interactions with literary texts as acts of creation. If we interpret mystical poetry for example, the Suﬁ poetry of Rumi, in which the concepts of divine union, peace, and metaphysical love are frequently encountered [ 10] we understand that not only the mysterious and the unknown are important for his poetry, but they constitute the central semantic core that deciphers the symbolism of his work. Rumi’s poetry does not require solely a linguistic or thematic analysis, but a deep engagement with the issues of Suﬁ spirituality, treating poetry as a means of knowing and experiencing transcendence, something that cannot be processed by the algorithmic procedures of AI. Artiﬁcial intelligence tools may be useful for identifying linguistic and ﬁgurative patterns, themes, and motifs, but any intervention in the deep emotional and metaphysical resonance that constitutes the essence of his poetry remains unachievable [ 11]. Human nature is the only one that can recognize and interact with these levels of experiencing and exploring existence.

More simply put, AI may be able to analyze the theme of loneliness in a literary work, but it cannot experience longing (mall), absence, the pain of being far from someone, and so forth. There is also a signiﬁcant difference in learning through experiences and situational learning, as this is the most successful known form of acquir- ing new knowledge [ 12]. The purpose of learning based on personal experience is to dissolve the boundary between scholastic learning and real life. As expected, based on attempts to use AI in the ﬁeld of literary studies, AI proves to be unsuccessful in the analysis of complex literary texts, which require the intervention of associative logic, emotional intelligence, and what has traditionally been referred to as “general culture.” Furthermore, the excessive consumption of time needed to “train” the application(s) often results in not facilitating human work; rather, the time spent using AI tends to exceed the time necessary to perform the speciﬁc analysis manually.

The irrational and unconscious elements of literature require a subjective interpretation, for which scholars position themselves through their opinions and analyses, undertaking a real academic risk. When a scholar analyzes, for example, The Trial by F. Kafka, they confront themes of absur- dity, existential anxiety, and the inexplicable nature of justice concepts that challenge logical explanation [ 14]. H. Arendt analyzes the effect of the arbitrariness of law and bureaucracy in The Trial [15], but without separating the literary phenomenon from the"

Arendt analyzes the effect of the arbitrariness of law and bureaucracy in The Trial [15], but without separating the literary phenomenon from the social and political context, since for her “violence appears at the moment when power is lost, because power and violence are opposites” [ 16]. 226 B. Ziﬂa and M. B. Halili H.-G. Gadamer in Truth and Method expresses that the way we understand the humanities is not simply a reproduction of facts, but an event, a phenomenon, where “something becomes known that was not previously available” [17]. This epistemologi- cal event, which helps us to achieve a new, innovative understanding of complex themes, underlines a critical distinction: AI can analyze patterns, schemes, but it lacks the ability for innovation, for intuitively grasping the unknown. Their role is thus understood not as a replacement for the work of scholars, but as an assistance in forms that can support and complement the interpretive process which is at the core of literary study. The preservation of an epistemology centered on the human being is essential at a time when AI is expanding its activity and rapidly integrating into all ﬁelds of human endeavor and scientiﬁc study. J. E. Aoun, in Robot-Proof, emphasizes the importance of safeguarding intellectual activity as an entirely human domain, since such an inclination is truly manifested only by the human being. “The ability to innovate requires humans to leverage their cognitive and emotional capacities in ways machines cannot” [ 18]."

Speciﬁcally, in literary studies, the ability to bring forth innovation is inseparable from the subjectivity and emotional involvement that humans have with texts. Although artiﬁcial intelligence possesses powerful processing capabilities, it cannot generate innovation in the same way, as it cannot engage with the metaphysical or irrational aspects of literature, nor can it produce the emotional and ethical interpretation that is essential for the study of the humanities. To understand the importance of originality in literary studies, we will focus on the qualities of the works of authors such as F. Dostoevsky, R. M. Rilke, and T. Mann, whose innovative nature demands original critical interpretations. For example, Dosto- evsky’s works explore profound philosophical and psychological themes and motifs. N. Berdyaev, in his analysis of Dostoevsky’s worldview, believes that Dostoevsky’s charac- ters are not merely literary constructions but embody profound metaphysical problems. Berdyaev analyzes in Dostoevsky the manifestation of a unique existential crisis, in which the very search for meaning becomes a journey that is both philosophical and spiritual. Within this human complexity, Berdyaev even distinguishes between the cul- tural conception of humanism (Western tradition) and a conception centered on spiritu-"

Within this human complexity, Berdyaev even distinguishes between the cul- tural conception of humanism (Western tradition) and a conception centered on spiritu- ality. “The Humanist conception of the world, a conception directed towards its psyche and not its spiritual aspect, turned away from the human’s ultimate spiritual self” [ 19]. Thus, Dostoevsky’s originality lies not only in the portrayal of human suffering but also in the way his characters represent the tension between spiritual repentance and moral decadence. The task of criticism is to confront these paradoxes and to bring forth inter- pretations that engage both with the metaphysical depth and with the internal complexity of the author’s literary work itself (e.g., Bakhtin’s criticism). Such criticism, despite the capabilities of technological tools in identifying textual patterns (pattern recognition), cannot intuitively grasp the philosophical questions posed by Dostoevsky’s work. Similarly, the deciphering of R. M. Rilke’s poetry is conditioned by the understand- ing of transcendence and mysticism. Rilke’s poetry never addresses a concrete, tangible, and realistic reality. As a follower of the romantic tradition of poetry as a high form of expressing transcendental truths, Rilke returns to the mystical spirit, and his poetry becomes obscure, moving away from simple understanding [ 20].

This novelty is elusive to the aesthetics of the era, as it brought about a radical shift in aesthetics, imagery, and poetic language, which would today imply the incapacity of artiﬁcial intelligence-based programs to grasp the novelty of his poetry, since the poetry itself resists deciphering through traditional, familiar tools of under- standing. The emotional and spiritual depth of Rilke’s work demands a critical approach that recognizes the poet’s exploration of the irrational and the unknown [ 21]. The inabil- ity of artiﬁcial intelligence to comprehend these intangible qualities limits its potential to offer a meaningful analysis of his poetry. Today, poetry that introduces as much novelty as Rilke’s did within its literary and historical context could not be analyzed according to the well-established models of text and aesthetic analysis, because modern poetry comes not to apply these models but to break and transform them. Two authors who established the modernism of the 20th century were J. Joyce and Th. Mann, whose works shattered all known boundaries of form and style.

The innovative use of the “stream of conscious- ness,” fragmentation, the heterogeneity of styles, and linguistic experimentation demand an approach that goes beyond the limits of previous methodologies of literary study, as its novelty also extended to the realm of thought. As H. Kenner notes, “The modernist innovation of Joyce was not simply in the content of his works but in the very form of language and thought” [ 22]. Similarly, Th. Mann’s work challenged the boundaries of literary form and style. In The Magic Mountain, Mann weaves a complex narrative that incorporates philosophy, science, and metaphysics. His innovative use of leitmotif as a musical and mental core model calls for an analysis of philosophical tradition and other arts, e.g., the analogy with the use of leitmotif in Wagner’s music. As Mann himself expresses, “I must make the effort to show that the apparent contradictions in human life are not contradictions but expressions of an underlying unity” [ 23]. This type of chal- lenging interpretation requires the critic to engage not only with the surface elements of the text but with deeper, often contradictory themes that are conditioned by the critic’s knowledge of philosophy and spiritualism.

The essential distinction lies in the fact that AI remains a powerful, precise, and particularly efﬁcient tool, but it cannot replace the human intellect’s capacity for original thought, emotional experience, and creative interpretation. In Reception The- ory, which emphasizes the importance of human emotional and intellectual response, the limitations of AI become even more apparent. W. Iser, in The Act of Reading, expresses that the interaction between the reader and the text is central to the creation of meaning; thus, the text provides the key data, but the reader ﬁlls them with their imagination [ 24]. This dynamic, created through the intellectual involvement of the reader in the act of reading, shapes the text itself, giving it form, and is not merely a passive reception [ 25]. Artiﬁcial Intelligence can assist with the analysis of themes and literary trends within large databases, but it cannot reproduce the breadth of emotional experience that makes the reading experience unique.

The Role of AI in Liter- ary Studies, a Symbiotic Approach: As AI technology continues to develop, its potential for transforming literary studies is immense. AI’s role should not be viewed as a replace- ment for human scholars, but rather as a complement to human intellect. While human intelligence excels at navigating the irrational, emotional, and philosophical complex- ities of literature, AI can enhance literary analysis by performing tasks such as pattern recognition, data processing, and thematic categorization. This symbiotic relationship allows scholars to focus on the interpretive and critical aspects of their work, using AI as a tool to augment their analyses. AI can signiﬁcantly assist in the analysis of large volumes of texts by identifying pat- terns, themes, and stylistic elements that may not be immediately apparent. These capa- bilities enable scholars to perform more efﬁcient and comprehensive research.

While AI can identify structural elements within a text, it cannot comprehend the emotional resonance or existential inquiries that deﬁne much of literary study. The role of AI in literary analysis, therefore, lies in supporting scholars rather than replacing them. One of the key strengths of human scholars is their ability to engage with the innova- tive aspects of literature. Literary works often present complex philosophical dilemmas, existential crises, and emotional conﬂicts that require deep, subjective interpretation. AI, in its current form, lacks the capacity for the kind of creative thinking and emotional engagement that is central to literary analysis. While AI can identify trends or provide data-driven insights, it cannot generate new, original interpretations or explore the intan- gible, metaphysical aspects of literature that are crucial for understanding the full depth of a text. The integration of AI into literary studies represents an epistemological shift, where AI’s data processing abilities allow scholars to approach literary analysis from new per- spectives. AI’s ability to handle large datasets and assist in complex textual analysis opens up new possibilities for literary research.

Given the rapid advancements in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in the ﬁeld of translation, ongoing debates persist in its ability to accurately interpret and convey cultural nuances particularly in idiomatic expressions and proverbs rich in rhetoric and metaphor. Such expressions frequently resist literal translation due to their deep connections to societal norms, values, and traditions. While AI-powered translation tools have signiﬁcantly improved in linguistic accuracy, they often struggle with contextual understanding and cultural sensitivity, leading to failure in capturing the intended connotation of idioms and proverbs. This study investigates the comparative effectiveness of AI translation tools and human translators in rendering culturally bound idioms and proverbs with both linguistic accuracy and contextual ﬁdelity. Adopting a mixed-methods approach, this study analyzes the translation of culturally signiﬁcant idioms and proverbs from Arabic, Turkish, and Albanian into English. The expressions are translated by both AI tools (i.e., Google Translate ChatGPT and DeepL) and professional human translators. Linguistic experts and native speakers evaluate the outputs based on accuracy, coherence, and cultural appropriateness.

The study compares how AI and human translators handle these challenges. Cultural Sensitivity ensures the cultural relevance of idioms is maintained in trans- lation. For example, “when pigs ﬂy” can be adapted in Turkish as “balık k a v ağa çıkı nca.”. Contextual Understanding means the idiom should suit the target language’s social and linguistic norms. Literal translations like “kick the bucket” may confuse readers if not adapted to reﬂect the intended ﬁgurative meaning. Idioms and proverbs often encapsulate cultural values, norms, and worldviews. For instance, the Arabic proverb “ ” (the pure heart) conveys notions of moral purity and spiritual sincerity deeply rooted in religious and social contexts. This differs from its English counterpart, “pure of heart,” which emphasizes innocence or good intentions but is less spiritually grounded. Similarly, in Albanian, the proverb “Gjuha të lidh, gjuha të zgjidh” (The tongue ties you, the tongue frees you) reﬂects the cultural emphasis on communication, wisdom, and consequences of speech. 234 A.

For instance, AI may translate idioms word-for-word, resulting in nonsensical or misleading outcomes. Therefore, human expertise remains indispensable in capturing the subtleties of cultural expressions, and this is the crux of the matter. Translating cultural expressions accurately is challenging because idioms and proverbs often carry meanings that are not directly translatable. Literal translations can distort the intended message, leading to confusion or misinterpretation. AI struggles with con- textual nuances, often failing to capture humor, sarcasm, or historical connotations. In contrast, human translators rely on cultural knowledge to adapt expressions while pre- serving their essence. Maintaining accuracy requires balancing linguistic ﬁdelity with cultural relevance. Existing translation research has extensively explored linguistic accuracy and cul- tural nuances in language pairs such as English-Arabic (e.g., Hamdi et al., 2025) [ 8], English-Albanian (e.g., Ajdini, 2024) [ 9], and English-Turkish (e.g., Liu et al., 2023) [10].

Elkins’s (2024) [ 15] study employed AI-driven approaches, including stylometry and emotional arc analysis, to assess how well translations preserve the original text’s nuances. The study uses Marcel Proust’s work as a case study to explore the creative choices made by translators and the complexities involved in literary translation. The ﬁndings demonstrated that while AI systems can identify stylistic and emotional trans- formations in literary translations, they remain inadequate for evaluating creative trans- lation decisions. This highlights the need for collaborative human-AI evaluation systems in literary translation analysis. The study conducted by Hajiyeva (2025) [ 16] explored the challenges of translating idioms and slang and the translation strategies employed to preserve meaning, tone and cultural resonance, emphasizing context, audience, and translator competence. The ﬁndings revealed that idioms are hard to translate due to their non-literal, context-bound nature that requires dynamic equivalence, paraphrasing and cultural substitution where translator’s awareness of the cultural context is essential for accurate translation.

These results underscore the continued importance of human expertise in tasks requiring nuanced linguistic judgment. Beyond the empirical data, the study suggests that future development of AI trans- lation systems should prioritize the integration of cultural knowledge bases, improved metaphor recognition, and adaptive contextual modeling.

Its implementation in agriculture has also expanded rapidly, transforming traditional farming systems into intelligent, data-driven, and sus- tainable operations. ML is now central to tasks such as crop classiﬁcation, disease detection, irrigation control, and yield optimization [ 3–5]. Botero-V alencia et al. [5] emphasized the role of ML in sustainable agriculture, show- ing how ensemble models like Random Forest and boosting techniques are increasingly applied to integrate multisource data such as satellite imagery, soil sensors, and weather records for robust agricultural predictions. Similarly, Araújo et al. [ 4] conducted a sys- tematic review that found 74.6% of ML use cases in agriculture were crop-related, iden- tifying major trends in crop quality analysis, disease identiﬁcation, and mapping using AI. V an Klompenburg et al. [ 6] re-viewed 50 ML-based studies and found that neural networks and environmental features like rainfall and temperature are commonly used predictors. Sun et al.

Similarly, Sharma and Kaur employed Support V ector Machines (SVM) for predict- ing rice plant diseases, highlighting the model’s performance limitations in multi-class and non-linear data scenarios [ 8–10]. XGBoost have gained popularity in agricultural datasets due to it robustness and ensemble based architecture. These models reduce over- ﬁtting and handle noise better than individual classiﬁers, making them ideal for complex datasets involving diverse crop types and environmental variables [ 11, 12]. Furthermore, Gaussian Naive Bayes, though based on strong independence assumptions, has shown competitive performance in agricultural classiﬁcation tasks, particularly where the input features have minimal correlation [ 5, 13]. Logistic Regression, while simpler, has also been used effectively in crop recommendation systems where the decision boundary is relatively linear. Its interpretability makes it useful for scenarios where understanding the model’s output is crucial for practical implementation by farmers and agronomists [ 14].

Systems such as IoT-Agro have already been applied in Colombian coffee farms, demonstrating real-time monitoring capabilities [ 16]. Precision agriculture is increasingly supported by Unmanned Aerial V ehicles (UA V), sensors, and advanced modeling. For example, Zha et al. [ 17] demonstrated that combining UA V imagery with ML improves nitrogen index estimation and crop yield forecasting. This aligns with work by Lobo et al. [ 18], who reviewed how UA Vs and IoT together enhance site-speciﬁc management in agriculture. Smart irrigation systems based on ML and IoT, like those described by Sridhar et al. [ 19] are being widely adopted to optimize water usage. These systems work well in conjunction with real-time sensor feedback [ 20]. Furthermore, Haval and Rahman [21] explored how combining AI and IoT can improve sustainability through automated nutrient management and energy-efﬁcient systems.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, various sensors are deployed to monitor agro environmental factors such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potas- sium (NPK), temperature, humidity, acidity or alkalinity -pH, and rainfall. These values are continuously collected and transmitted to a central processing unit, a microcontroller. The microcontroller manages data ﬂow between sensors, power supply (through a phase induction system), and communication modules such as Wi-Fi and cellular/mobile data. Collected data is uploaded to a cloud platform (ThingSpeak), where it can be visualized or fed into machine learning models.

These metrics offer insights into the predictive behavior of the models under multiclass settings, particularly their ability to correctly classify crops based on agro-environmental inputs. k-Fold Cross-V alidation is a statistical resampling technique used to evaluate the generalization ability of a machine learning model. In the case of 5-fold cross-validation, the dataset D = {(xi, yi)}n i=1 is partitioned into 5 disjoint subsets of approximately equal size: D = 5 j=1 Dj Di ∩ Dj = ∅ for i j(7) For each fold k = 1, 2, …, 5, the model is trained on the union of 4 folds by Eq.

Comparison of Classiﬁcation Accuracy Across Machine Learning Models By selecting the most appropriate machine learning model and developing corre- sponding software, it becomes possible to predict the most suitable crop—whether a fruit or vegetable—for cultivation, given the soil composition and prevailing climatic conditions. Once the relevant environmental and soil parameters are known, they can be input into the system, which then provides a crop recommendation. For instance, using the trained Random Forest model (see above Fig. 6), and the following input parameters: Nitrogen (N): 10, Phosphorus (P): 125, Potassium (K): 196, Temperature: 22.31 °C, Humidity: 90.04%, pH: 5.73, Rainfall: 113.07 mm, the model predicted that apple is the most suitable crop for cultivation under these conditions, see Fig. 8. Machine Learning and Mathematical Modeling 259 Fig. 8. Crop prediction using Random Forest mode To demonstrate the practical application of the trained Gaussian Naive Bayes model, a sample input was tested with known soil and climate parameters (see above Fig. 8).

Crop prediction using Gaussian Naive Bayes model 5 Discussion The six machine learning models were tested, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gaussian Naive Bayes were consistently achieved the highest classiﬁcation accuracies, exceeding 99% in some cases. These ﬁndings are consistent with prior research, where ensemble and probabilistic models demonstrated outstanding performance in agricultural classi- ﬁcation tasks [ 9, 28, 29]. Despite their different theoretical foundations, these models achieved high accuracy due to their mathematically complementary strengths. Random Forest constructs numerous independent decision trees, each trained on random subsets of the dataset and features, a strategy known as bagging. This ensemble approach sig- niﬁcantly reduces overﬁtting by lowering model variance. The ﬁnal prediction is made by majority voting in classiﬁcation or averaging in regression, leveraging the collec- tive knowledge of the ensemble [ 10]. Mathematically, this results in more stable and generalizable predictions across diverse agricultural conditions. In contrast, XGBoost builds trees sequentially, with each new tree correcting the residuals of the previous ones."

It assumes conditional independence among features, sim- plifying computation while still achieving competitive results when features are loosely correlated. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes performed remarkably well in our exper- iments, which aligns with prior work demonstrating its efﬁciency and accuracy in crop classiﬁcation problems [ 28, 30]. The success of these models suggests that the crop recommendation dataset is not only well-structured but also sufﬁciently expressive to allow both ensemble learners and probabilistic models to identify decision boundaries with high accuracy.

Support V ector Machines (SVMs), by contrast, rely on maximizing the margin between classes and assume that a clear boundary can be drawn, which limits their effectiveness when data is non-linear or involves multiple overlapping classes. As such, SVMs underperformed relative to the ensemble and probabilistic models tested. The superior performance of Random Forest and XGBoost can be attributed to their ensemble strategies, Random Forest through parallel tree-based variance reduction and XGBoost through iterative bias correction.

Driven by the fears of exposure and breaches, the provision of data to interested parties such as government agen- cies, and security companies has become increasingly limited. In response to these concerns, we have explored best practices and advanced models for processing and anonymizing citizen data tables. Traditional techniques fail to balance data utility with privacy. This paper proposes a two-tier privacy framework: a) a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) model based on a deep learn- ing data synthesizer, which maintain statistical ﬁdelity while mitigating the risks of re-identiﬁcation, and b) an API-mediated access system that allows interested authorized parties to dynamically query synthetic data and perform statistical anal- yses without compromising data security. Based on our analysis, the synthetic data preserves approximately 92% of the utility of the original data, meaning the statis- tical structure (SD metrics) is preserved. Also, the re-identiﬁcation risk has been reduced to nearly 0% - representing nearly 100% reduction in re-identiﬁcation risk from the original data (with 1.8% success rate in penetration test).

A study referring to these concerns was conducted in 2011 [ 3]. Although this article addresses the issues of data access and visualization, the time distance makes this research out of date in matters such as anonymization techniques with AI applications. Also, the amount of data presently being managed has increased dramatically, and datasets are becoming more complex, both in terms of the nature of the data and their format. In [4], the focus is mainly on legal issues, including the regulatory framework from the perspective of human rights, the right to information, the preservation of privacy, etc. It does not address speciﬁc issues of data administration, and their use from a scientiﬁc point of view, such as anonymization, statistical analysis, etc. The Report described in [ 5] is a policy document that mainly addresses who are authorities that administer these categories of data, how they should interact, and the implementation of international and national acts."

Based on ﬁndings in the Report of the European Commission for 2023 [ 6], Albania has made signiﬁcant progress in aligning the statistical evaluation with standards of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) [ 7]. Moreover, there are several traditional techniques for data anonymization such as Random Masking, Noise Injection, K-anonymity, L-diversity etc. However, they have signiﬁcant limitations when applied to citizens’ data. These limitations can be summarized as follows: • Structural Integrity: These methods often disrupt underlying data distributions. Random masking and Noise Injection can corrupt relationships between variables. • Bias Ampliﬁcation: Rare subgroups (e.g., speciﬁc marital statuses or political afﬁliations) are frequently erased or distorted due to oversimpliﬁed sampling. • Privacy Risks: Masking may leak information if suppression rules are improperly conﬁgured and Noise addition requires careful calibration to avoid re-identiﬁcation through residual patterns. • Scalability: Performance degrades when handling high-dimensional, mixed-type data at scale. With the aim to overcome these limitations, we have chosen CTGAN architecture [8] to build a deep learning data synthesizer.

The algorithm implementation and programming were carried out in Python as it offers several advantages for this purpose, including: powerful data handling libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, SDV); ﬂexibility with real-world data, such as column standard- ization and dynamic merging; support for automation and reproducibility; and Interop- erability with various formats and platforms (e.g., CSV , Excel, databases, APIs, and web applications). 3.3 Data Preprocessing The initial step involves data cleaning and enrichment, which includes standardizing table formats, addressing missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types,"

Data cleaning and organization were performed using the appropriate libraries, fol- lowed by merging all datasets into a single consolidated table. The code is available in GitHub [ 11].

Its ability to generate high-quality synthetic data makes it a secure and practical choice for preserving privacy. In our case, CTGAN training involves high-cardinality quasi-identiﬁers, Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII), and sparse or complex categorical data ensuring real- istic synthetic data generation. An open-source Synthetic Data V ault (SDV) Python library [ 13] was used for synthetic data generation and evaluation.

Finally, SDV enhances integration by enabling seamless compatibility with advanced features, including relational data synthesis, further extending its utility in complex data generation tasks. The system balances underrepresented groups, such as married versus divorced indi- viduals, to improve dataset fairness. A key advantage is that the synthesized data cannot be traced back to real citizens, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. The system also allows for controlled generation, enabling users to simulate speciﬁc demographic groups, e.g., simulating 1,000 voters from a particular minority “x”. Furthermore, when properly conﬁgured, the system demonstrates strong scalability, efﬁciently handling large datasets without compromising performance.

Synthetic records were compared against the original dataset using quasi-identiﬁers (age, gender, salary, marital status, gross salary, occupa- tion). Only 1.8% success rate of synthetic records could be matched to real individuals, conﬁrming the near-elimination of re-identiﬁcation risks.

The forecasting performance of Bi-LSMT model is evaluated against traditional technical analysis methods to assess the feasibility and practical relevance for individual investors.

The Albanian foreign exchange market has received less attention in the literature on ﬁnancial forecasting. Traditional statistical models often suffer from volatil- ity, non-linearity, and the incorporation of macroeconomic context. Although tech- nical analysis offers insights based on patterns, it cannot adjust to shifting temporal dependencies. One of the most signiﬁcant issues facing both human and, more recently, artiﬁcial intelligence has long been ﬁnancial market forecasting.

The intricacy and volatility of ﬁnancial markets have often proven difﬁcult for tra- ditional AI research, which has focused mostly on creating intelligent systems that aim to mimic human reasoning. In particular, the foreign exchange market is naturally very volatile and complex (non-linear). Investors remain hopeful that market dynamics can be comprehended in spite of these challenges, especially given the powerful modeling, pattern recognition, and forecasting capabilities of AI systems. One unique characteristic of artiﬁcial neural networks in particular is their ability to generalize or recognize and interpret patterns that were not explicitly pre-sent in the training dataset. Since most predictive modeling tasks use historical data to predict future trends, neural networks are especially well-suited for ﬁnancial forecasting. Because of the large amount of historical data and the strong correlation between past patterns and future movements, ﬁnancial markets offer an ideal environment for neural network training [ 1–3]. In the ﬁeld of time series forecasting, a wide variety of approaches have been put forth, ranging from exponential smoothing techniques and their modiﬁcations to more conven- tional statistical models like the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and its variations, such as Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) [ 4].

To overcome this limitation, researchers have been using deep learning methods more and more, particularly Re- current Neural Networks (RNNs), a subset of Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs). These net-works are especially well-suited to capture complex patterns in time series data and nonlinear systems to facilitate more accurate long-term forecasts [ 8–11].

Early neural network models were applied to detect buy/sell signals or fore- cast price changes based on technical indicators, yet they often lacked robust learning mechanisms to handle market volatility and noise effectively [ 12–15].

Similarly, in their paper [18] authors review 82 soft computing hybrids, reinforcing the trend toward integrated approaches that combine machine learning techniques with domain expertise. Regarding decision support, Basilio et al.

These contributions emphasize the growing sophistication in the investment decision support systems. Most recent advances have focused on time series forecasting using deep learn- ing. LSTM and Bi-LSTM architecture have gained traction for their ability to model long-term dependencies and complex temporal patterns. Comparative studies by Siami- Namini et al. [ 22] and Pirani et al.

A ﬁve-class system is used to reﬂect varying degrees of directional movement, while a binary classiﬁer captures simple upward/downward trends. 3.2 Technical Analysis and Feature Engineering Technical analysis remains a foundational tool in ﬁnancial forecasting, grounded in theories such as Dow Theory, Elliott Wave theory, and Fibonacci patterns [ 29]. These theories rely on the analysis of charts and their accompanying indicators to forecast the short, medium, and long-term behavior of ﬁnancial markets. The computerization of data obtained from charts and indicators to determine the optimal moments for opening and closing positions, as well as the use of AI, presents one of the major challenges for technical analysts. Being successful as a technical analyst requires a consistent under- standing of the relationship between indicators, price, and volume. By combining various indicators, technical analysts can forecast price targets more accurately. The use of indi- cators such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands (BB), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), and Rate of Change (ROC) are computed using Python based libraries and normalize to a 0–1 scale. This normalization ensures consistent input ranges for the neural network, avoid- ing scale-induced bias. The new concept of a trend, not as a straight line passing through"

The new concept of a trend, not as a straight line passing through two successive highs or lows on the chart, but as a curve represented by the EMA, lies at the foundation of this analysis. These Moving Averages and the market’s reaction to their values are key factors in forecasting future market behavior. The evaluation of mar- ket behavior near EMA values, combined with their relative positions and signals from the MACD indicator, constitutes the essence of improving the efﬁciency of ﬁnancial operations. An additional feature engineering steps embeds signiﬁcant macroeconomic events, e.g., the 1997 Albanian ﬁnancial crisis, the 2008 global recession, and the COVID-19 pandemic using label encoding. This allows the model to learn from sudden structural shifts in the market. 3.3 Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM RNNs are suited for sequential data as they retain information from previous time steps. However, RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem during training, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies [ 31]. As the network is being trained, 286 L. Lamani et al. gradients must propagate through a series of matrix multiplications due to the chain rule. This leads to the issue where the ﬁnal gradient update either diminishes to very small values (vanishing gradients) or increases exponentially (exploding gradients). In the ﬁrst case, the weights become too small to update, and the network cannot learn, while in"

In the ﬁrst case, the weights become too small to update, and the network cannot learn, while in the second case, unstable updates to the parameters occur. Figure 1 presents the RNNs architecture. Fig. 1. RNN architecture RNNs cannot process long sequences during training and fail to capture context from previous time steps during inference. This creates challenges in modeling real- world sequential data, especially in technical analysis of ﬁnancial markets. To address this limitation, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used. LSTM networks address this issue by introducing gating mechanisms, namely, the input, forget, and output gates, that regulate the ﬂow of information and preserve long- term memory [ 10, 11, 22]. These gates enable the model to retain relevant context over longer sequences, which is critical in ﬁnancial time series where lag effects and delayed responses are common. Figure 2 presents a comparison between RNN and LSTM architecture. Fig. 2. RNN vs. LSTM architecture As can be seen from the ﬁgure, LSTM architecture includes an additional component called the cell state, which stores memory from earlier steps. At each time step, three components work together: the current input, the hidden state for short-term memory, and the cell state for long-term memory.

The three gates are: Input Gate, Forget Gate, and Output Gate. 3.4 Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Bidirectional LSTMs (Bi-LSTMs) networks consist of two LSTM layers: one processes input sequences forward in time, while the other processes them in reverse. There is an extension of traditional LSTMs that improve model performance on tasks where the entire sequence is needed, such as sequence classiﬁcation, speech recognition, and forecasting [ 27]. As is presented in Fig. 3, a Bi-LSTM consists of two LSTMs: one processes the input in the forward direction (left to right), while the other processes the input in reverse (right to left). This architecture allows Bi-LSTMs to leverage more information, providing the model with increased context to learn from. Fig. 3. Bi-LSTM architecture This architecture is particularly effective for forecasting tasks where both past and future context contribute to prediction accuracy [23, 25, 27]. Forex markets are inﬂuenced by both historical data (past events) and potential future trends. A Bi-LSTM can capture dependencies in both directions: past to present (forward) and present to future (back- ward).

This allows the model to better understand the full context of market movements, which is essential for accurate forecasting, as forex price action is often inﬂuenced by both immediate past behavior and upcoming trends or events. Bidirectional processing allows the model to process the same data from both the past and the future, providing a richer representation of the data. For example, news events, market sentiment, or geopo- litical changes may affect the market both before and after they occur. Bi-LSTMs can capture both the cause and effect of these events. Forex forecasting requires multiple inputs: historical prices, technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD), and possibly even fundamental factors like interest rates or geopolitical news. Bi-LSTMs can handle these multi-dimensional inputs effectively and adapt to changes in market conditions. As mentioned earlier, a comparison of RNN models, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM has been conducted in [ 22, 23] and in [ 25]. 288 L.

While computationally intensive, this step signiﬁcantly improves ﬁnal forecasting accuracy. 4 Results 4.1 Optimal Hyperparameter Conﬁguration Using Keras Tuner, 20 randomized search trials were conducted to identify the most effective hyperparameter combinations for forecasting EUR/ALL and USD/ALL exchange rates. The optimized conﬁgurations are as follows; a) USD/ALL • Number of attention heads: 6 • Attention key dimension: 48 • LSTM units (ﬁrst Bi-LSTM layer): 128 • Dense layer units: 128 • Dropout rate: 0.2 • Attention dense units: 64 b) EUR/ALL • Number of attention heads: 8 • Attention key dimension: 48 • LSTM units (ﬁrst Bi-LSTM layer): 128 • Dense layer units: 32 • Dropout rate: 0.2 • Attention dense units: 64 These conﬁgurations indicate a moderately deep architecture with bidirectional tem- poral encoding and focused multi-head attention layers, effectively balancing model complexity with performance. 4.2 Model Performance Model evaluation was conducted on a holdout validation set using two common regression metrics.

These values reﬂect a reasonably good level of accuracy for short-term forecasting of exchange rates, considering the inherent volatility of the Forex market. These results indicate that the model achieved a relatively low forecasting error when predicting EUR/ALL exchange rates. In comparison to the USD/ALL case (RMSE: A Bi-LSTM and Technical Analysis-Based Framework 291 Table 4. Quantitative Evaluation.

This difference may stem from several factors, including the lower inherent volatility of the EUR/ALL pair or more consistent patterns in its time series, which the model can more effectively capture. The raw exchange rate, EMA200, and MACD histogram contributed most signiﬁ- cantly to predictive performance. This aligns with ﬁnancial intuition, as these indicators often underpin trend-following strategies.

Attention weights and empirical results highlight the importance of momentum-based indicators, with MACD histogram and ROC consistently receiving the highest attention scores. The relatively low MAE suggests that the model effectively tracks gradual price trends and short-term ﬂuctuations. However, the higher RMSE could imply difﬁculty in accounting for sudden shocks or external market inﬂuences such as central bank interventions or macroeconomic news. From a practical perspective, a lower RMSE and MAE imply greater reliability in short-term EUR/ALL forecasts, potentially offering more dependable support for trading strategies or monetary policy monitoring. These ﬁndings validate the beneﬁt of combining Bi-LSTM networks with attention mechanisms and domain-speciﬁc technical indicators in ﬁnancial time series forecasting. The hybrid approach shows potential for practical applications in decision support for currency trading and economic planning. 4.4 Forecast Visualization with Technical Indicators a) Short-Term Forecast (USD/ALL and EUR/ALL 21-Day Horizon) Forecast visualizations show that the predicted price trends closely follow actual market"

The Rate of Change (ROC) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) also contributed signiﬁcantly. In contrast, the raw EUR price, EMA50, and EMA200 were given less weight, suggesting that the model prioritizes momentum and oscillator signals over smoothed trend lines. This supports ﬁndings in [ 8, 27, 29] that momentum indicators are particularly effective when paired with deep learning models in ﬁnancial time series forecasting. 4.6 Multi-class Classiﬁcation The ﬁve-class classiﬁcation model provides interpretable directional forecasts.

Notably, OpenACC [ 4] requires less programming effort compared to low-level models like CUDA and OpenCL, as much of the parallelization is handled by the compiler with minimal code restructuring [ 4]. Zhao et al. [ 5] proposed PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) as a solution to efﬁciently train large models, overcoming the challenges associated with resource- intensive training. While large models offer signiﬁcant performance improvements across various domains, their use has been restricted to a small group of advanced users due to technical barriers. FSDP addressed this issue by being co-designed with key PyTorch components like tensor implementation, dispatcher systems, and CUDA memory allocators, designing a seamless, non-intrusive user experience. Experimental results showed that FSDP delivered comparable performance to Distributed Data Par- allel (DDP) while supporting much larger models, achieving near-linear scalability in terms of Tera Floating Point Operations Per Second (TFLOPS) [ 5]. 302 M.

DaPPA consists of three key components: (i) Data-Parallel Pattern APIs, which provide ﬁve primary data-parallel pattern primitives to express data transformations. (ii) a Dataﬂow Programming Interface, enabling the deﬁnition of data movement across patterns. (iii) Dynamic Template-Based Compilation, which uses code skeletons and dynamic transformations to generate optimized UPMEM binaries.

It reaches its peak at around 380K, then it starts to decline for a bit – until a slow rise. 5 Discussion The benchmarking results clearly demonstrate the advantage of parallel data load- ing in training machine learning models, particularly as dataset size increases. Using num_workers = 2 in PyTorch’s DataLoader, we observed consistent reductions in data loading time compared to sequential loading (num_workers = 0), resulting in speedups ranging from approximately 0.4× to 1.78× across the tested dataset sizes. As expected, the beneﬁt of parallel loading becomes more pronounced with larger datasets. For smaller datasets (e.g., 100,000–300,000 samples), the difference in loading time is less dramatic due to minimal I/O overhead and shorter training epochs. However, starting from around 400,000 samples and beyond, parallel loading starts delivering consistent and meaningful time savings. This is likely because larger datasets involve more frequent disk or memory access during batch preparation, and having multiple workers allows for concurrent pre-fetching of data while the model is training on the previous batch.

The computational part of the training forward pass, loss computation, Evaluating the Impact of Parallel Data Loading 305 backpropagation, and optimizer updates remains single-threaded on the CPU (in this test). Therefore, the total speedup is bounded by the proportion of time spent loading data. Another observation is the diminishing returns in speedup with very large datasets. Beyond a certain point (e.g., around 3 to 5 million samples), the speedup gains begin to plateau. This suggests that the data loading bottleneck is effectively mitigated at a certain level of parallelism, and further improvements may require either:  Increasing num_workers  Using faster I/O systems  Or overlapping training and data loading more efﬁciently Finally, these results validate the importance of efﬁcient data pipelines in machine learning workﬂows.

By systematically testing dataset sizes from 100,000 to 5,000,000 samples, we demonstrated that parallel data loading (with num_workers = 2) consistently outperforms sequential loading, resulting in speedups of up to 1.78× in data loading time. The performance gain becomes more pronounced as dataset size increases, making parallel loading an effective optimization strategy for large-scale training scenarios. While the total training time per epoch is inﬂuenced by both data loading and compu- tation, the results conﬁrm that minimizing I/O delays through parallelism leads to more efﬁcient training cycles.

Based on the comparative analysis of recent advancements in machine learning opti- mization, future work should focus on unifying the strengths of these diverse approaches into integrated toolchains.

The initial sequential execution time (1 thread) was recorded as 62,908 milliseconds as shown in Table 1. The clear observation from the results obtained from Table 1 is that after 8 threads, the execution time plateaus, indicating thread saturation and diminishing returns beyond moderate parallelism. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the number of threads and the speedup achieved on the baseline v5e−1 TPU system without any additional compiler optimiza- tions. The speedup improves steadily up to 8 threads, after which a plateauing effect is observed. The maximum speedup of approximately 8× is recorded at 16 and 32 threads. These results demonstrate the scalability beneﬁts of moderate parallelism while highlighting the saturation point beyond which additional threads provide diminishing returns.

Performance improvements with compiler optimizations were observed past 8 threads, however, the rate of improvement remained lower as further parallelism was introduced. The plateau effect follows Amdahl’s Law: once the sequential portion domi- nates, adding parallel threads yields diminishing returns. Responsively managing slack resources becomes vital when saturation is met to maximize system underutilization for real-time ECG monitoring systems without excess waste. Although the proposed pipeline shows performance improvements, this study did not include clinical or real-world latency thresholds. In critical care applications, ECG systems are expected to meet real-time constraints under 100ms per cycle. Future validation will quantify whether the current pipeline achieves such thresholds under deployment-speciﬁc conditions. 5 Discussion and Comparison This research analyzed the effect of thread-level parallelism and compiler optimizations on the real-time processing of ECG signals parallelized with OpenMP . The analysis done on different levels of threading and optimization schemes resulted in some notable observations.

The speedup kept improving parallel until 6 threads, where a 5.3× speedup was observed in comparison to sequential execution. However, a clear plateau in performance gain was observed past 8 threads. This indicates saturation - additional threads offer diminishing returns due to increased overhead and resource contention. In the second instance, performance was boosted further to even greater levels by applying the compiler optimizations previously mentioned to all levels of threading. Speciﬁcally, the conﬁguration using-O3 -fopenmp-simd –march = native -funroll-loops dominated with 15.5× speedup at 32 threads, compared to the baseline max of 8.0×. 316 B. Demir and E. Domazet This exempliﬁes the extent to which parallel performance can be enhanced through compiler-level optimizations, especially in near real-time, time-sensitive biomedical applications. The examination of several OpenMP scheduling methods (dynamic, static, and guided) indicated that no single scheduling method was optimal for all thread counts, though some differences between methods did exist. Static scheduling tended to have the upper hand at higher thread counts, indicating that more predictable distribution of workload contributes to reduce overhead for embarrassingly parallel tasks such as patient-wise ECG analysis.

Beyond this range, only aggressive compiler optimizations could yield any further beneﬁt, and even then, the beneﬁts were most apparent at natural parallel saturation points. Moreover, the results suggest that the best OpenMP scheduling strategy is determined both by workload par- titioning and hardware ceilings, reinforcing that scheduling strategies must be crafted to meet the precise demands of the use-case scenario. While this study shows improvements in processing speed, it is still critical to address the lack of testing with noisy, real-world ECG signals from wearable sensors. The MIT- BIH dataset is free from noise and artifacts, so testing in the presence of signal artifacts such as motion or EMG noise will be essential to conﬁrm reliability and trustworthiness. Additionally, the paper primarily focused on the beneﬁts of speedup from OpenMP , overlooking its memory, power, and accuracy versus speed focus in comparison to CUDA or MPI-based systems. We consider these omissions highly relevant for further research. Ultimately, the ﬁndings stress that the architecture of parallel and distributed ECG systems must integrate multi-threading alongside aggressive compiler and runtime tun- ing to adhere to the strict latency thresholds set by real-time edge monitoring and diagnostic systems."

This is the cornerstone of our analysis which centers on scalability, speedup efﬁciency, hardware utilization, and overall practicality within edge and distributed systems. CUDA-based GPU-accelerated biosignal ﬁltering, as demonstrated by Domazet et al.

[ 16] investigated the cloud and multi-core CPU platforms for the purposes of analyzing scalable biomedical data, but did not utilize the aggressive compiler optimizations coupled with parallel threading that is the hallmark of our approach. What sets our framework apart is the application of OpenMP multithreading, ﬁle- level parallelism of distributed scope, and thorough compilation optimizations detailed above which includes -O3, -fopenmp-simd, -march = native, -funroll-loops, resulting in speedups of up to 15.5×.

Deep learn- ing – in particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) – in the last few years has been responsible for tremendous advances in medical image classiﬁcation, including pathol- ogy image analysis [ 5, 6]. Nonlinear CNN-based models are capable of capturing subtle morphological features in images of tissues and can differentiate between malignant and benign lesions with great accuracy [37]. Indeed, deep methods have shown impressive performance in breast cancer pathology, delivering faster, more reproducible, and accu- rate diagnoses in research environments. Recent studies report that cutting-edge CNN models can attain over 90% accuracy in classifying benchmark histology images such as BreakHis [ 7]. These performances highlight the capability of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in matching or even surpassing expert pathologists in diagnostic performance [ 8]. Correspondingly, contemporary computer-aided diagnosis systems have been designed to automatically classify breast histopathology images that would alleviate clinicians’ workload and help ensure diagnostic uniformity [ 9]. Deep-learning-based CAD sys- tems (Computer Aided Detection)) for breast cancer have shown performance in tumor subtypes classiﬁcation, grading of malignancy, and prediction of patient prognosis that constitutes a major step toward more efﬁcient and trustworthy pathology workﬂows."

Notwithstanding these advancements, training high-resolution pathology images in deep CNN models poses signiﬁcant computational issues. WSIs are often extremely large (usually in the order of 50,000 × 50,000) and thus feeding an entire WSI into a CNN at native resolution is computationally infeasible. Researchers thus use patch- based strategies instead – splitting WSIs into thousands of smaller tile images – as in the BreakHis data set with more than 9,000 microscopic images of breast tumors at different magniﬁcations. Even for patch-based datasets, model training has high memory and pro- cessing requirements. Histopathology CNNs are often themselves deep and need large sets of training examples (increased through transformations by rotation, color jittering, etc.), resulting in extensive training times. For instance, a recent study in digital pathol- ogy reported that training a deep classiﬁcation network consumed 38 h on a four-GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) server based on NVIDIA A100 GPUs [ 10]. The same gen- eral rule of thumb is that creating high-precision models in histopathology using deep learning often necessitates special GPU hardware and large computation resources, even using multi-GPU clusters for processing throughputs [ 11].

Therefore, parallel computing and GPU acceleration have become a must for state-of- the-art deep learning in histopathology in order to enable computation of complicated models within reasonable timeframes, allowing researchers for trying out innovative models or exhaustive hyper-parameter tuning [ 14]. With these computational methods complemented by robust deep learning methods, one can seek to develop efﬁcient and scalable CAD systems for pathology. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-accelerated deep learning system for efﬁcient histopathological breast cancer image classiﬁcation based on parallel computation for faster training while achieving high diagnostic performance. We use the BreakHis col- lection of breast cancer images of tumors (benign vs. malignant) and a CNN-based classiﬁer in PyTorch for implementing a PyTorch model.

Initial research in these years primar- ily employed transfer learning from pre-trained CNNs, which according to Zhou et al. were some of the most prevalent methods for breast cancer histology classiﬁcation [ 15]. To name just one example, Heikal et al. transferred custom and pre-trained CNN models on the BreakHis collection of 7,909 breast histopathology images from four differ- ent magniﬁcations in order to separate malignant from benign tumors [ 16]. Their cus- tom CNN surpassed top-performing off-the-shelves architecture models (MobileNetV3, EfﬁcientNet-B0, VGG16, ResNet50V2) for as much as 84% accuracy without spe- cial tuning [ 17]. With sophisticated hyperparameter tuning (e.g. Grey Wolf and Gorilla Troops optimizers), their custom model achieved 93.13% accuracy on BreakHis, signif- icantly outperforming the 74–82% range of conventional pre-trained models. Likewise, Islam et al. [17] constructed a customized CNN for differentiating invasive ductal carci- noma (IDC) from non-cancer and metastatic from benign cells, achieving 89% accuracy in detecting IDC and 95% in distinguishing metastasis— a notable improvement from previous methods for these tasks.

These results highlight that properly optimized CNN models by and large initialized from ImageNet weights have been able to deliver high performance on limited pathology collections through extracting discriminative tumor features. Aside from straightforward CNN designs, methods have been investigated for captur- ing histology images’ rich multi-scale and contextuality. One approach has been applying multiple instance learning and attention mechanisms for pulling together multiple small patches’ information into slide-level prediction. An example is that of Shao et al. [ 18], who described TransMIL, a transformer-based MIL framework applying self-attention Parallel Computing for Efﬁcient Histopathological Image Classiﬁcation 323 for capturing features’ relationship between patches for whole-slide image classiﬁca- tion. These models based on attention overcome the limitation of vanilla CNNs whose receptive ﬁelds are ﬁxed and can lack global context. Another innovation has been in integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) models and hybrid CNN–Transformer models. Long-range dependencies in tissue pattern can in theory be captured by transformers through self-attention but at higher computational cost. Springenberg et al.

Their ﬁndings on the BreakHis dataset revealed that recent CNNs (e.g. ConvNeXt, InceptionV3) and transformers (e.g. ViT, Swin Transformer) were both able to attain top-class accuracy e.g. InceptionV3 achieved 92.3% and Swin-Transformer 92.2% multi-class accuracy on BreakHis when appropri- ately pretrained and ﬁnetuned. The experiment also underscored robustness against stain variations and interpretability of models for deployment in clinic. Transformers have also been used for particular subtasks; Abimouloud et al. [ 20] invented a hybrid “TokenMix- er” architecture integrating ConvMixer-type CNN tokenization and ViT encoders. On the BreakHis dataset, their hybrid achieved a stunning 97.0% binary (benign/malignant) and 93.3% 8-class subtype accuracy for multiple magniﬁcations. These models based on attention (hybrids and ViTs) use global context and multi-head attention for enhanced feature learning, and have come to outperform or complement CNNs, particularly where multi-scale context in tissues is highly important (e.g., separation of tumor subtypes or detection of rare tumor areas). All in all, the period between 2020 and 2024 indicates a shift from strictly CNN-based solutions towards transformer and attention-augmented networks in histopathology that regularly produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets such as BreakHis and four-class BACH challenge set (in which a hierarchical"

Many studies in the last 5 years show that well-designed ensembles – either through combining multiple neural networks or multi-scale feature extractors – can enhance accuracy and reliability in breast cancer histopathology classiﬁcation. For instance, Khan et al. introduced the MSF-Model, an ensemble of multi-scale feature fusion for breast cancer histology [ 21]. Their framework included two parallel paths, each consisting of three different CNN structures (ResNet, DenseNet, EfﬁcientNet), for a total of six feature extractors for multiple magniﬁcations. Through feature fusion from these paths, the ensemble obtained higher accuracy for breast tumor patch classiﬁcation, and was shown to generalize under domain shift (man- aging variability in datasets). This highlights the advantage of ensemble models that are specialized in distinct scales or feature type, particularly suitable for histopathology where tumors can appear in different resolutions."

A pair of augmented CNNs based on an attention mechanism were 324 E. Dupljak and E. Domazet proposed by Karthik et al. – CSAResNet and DAMCNN – and had their predictions com- bined to draw from rich representations of features. On the BreakHis dataset, 99.55% accuracy for binary classiﬁcation was obtained through this combination of an attention ensemble [ 23], virtually approaching perfection on that task. That is far superior per- formance compared to individual models alone and demonstrates what one can gain by applying ensembling in order to counterbalance particular model biases. Arya and Saha [23], also documented that an ensemble of classiﬁers based on deep models improved breast histopathology image analysis compared to individual networks. Ensembles are not required to have identical modalities; some models form hybrid ensembles blending CNNs and transformers. One example is an ensemble of a ViT and a distilled transformer (DeiT) that was investigated for stabilizing and enhancing transformer predictions from limited histology data.

The overall result in these studies is that ensemble methods repeatedly provided higher accuracy and, in some cases, improved generalization to external datasets. The drawback is higher computational load and com- plexity, but having adequate resources in GPUs (as described in more detail below in the Subsect. 2.3), ensemble models have achieved new performance records on datasets including BreakHis and BACH [ 21, 23]. 2.3 GPU Acceleration and Parallel Computing in Medical Imaging The power of GPUs and parallel computing paradigms has been instrumental in deploy- ing and training deep learning models in medical images, and most especially in com- putationally demanding histopathology tasks. Analysis of breast cancer histopathology typically encompasses gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) or batches of large image patches and requires computational efﬁciency. More recent work has thus focused on using GPU acceleration, multi-GPU training, and high-performance computing (HPC) methods to tackle such workloads. In terms of training, researchers have increased model development by using multiple GPUs in parallel.

This enabled learning from tens of thousands of per-slide image tiles using advanced self-supervised techniques. Due to such huge parallelism, their resulting foundation model is capable of generating slide- level tumor representations and achieving slide inference in under a second per WSI – a speedup unachievable without using GPUs. In model inference and clinical deployment scenarios alike, parallel computing meth- ods have also been found to be indispensable in terms of throughput and scalability. A notable work by Li et al. [ 25] showed the acceleration of WSI tumor detection using an HPC on the Camelyon breast cancer metastasis dataset. By using a high performance computing (HPC) cluster of thousands of CPU cores to compute image patches in par- allel (and optimized data pipelines using HDF5 to minimize I/O), they compressed the effective inference time on 399 whole slide images from an estimated 30 days on a single GPU to <45 h on the cluster. This sharp reduction has shown that parallelization of the workload (either across numerous CPU cores or GPUs) is capable of achieving practical turnaround times to analyze large-scale slide images.

This is directly extendable to breast histopathology segmentation or multi-tissue classiﬁcation tasks where runtime is important. Besides raw hardware speeds, software libraries have developed to accommodate real-time and distributed processing of pathology images. Libraries such as cuCIM and RAPIDS (NVIDIA) facilitate slide I/O and data preprocessing on GPUs [ 28], whereas open-source applications like Slideﬂow combine real-time GPU inferencing with inter- active visualization.

      "text": "5 Discussion and Future Work The proposed framework of CNN with GPU acceleration shows strong promise towards efﬁcient and accurate breast cancer histopathology image classiﬁcation. The transfer learning combined with parallelized training and preprocessing led to competitive per- formance (94.8%) and considerable training time reductions—obtaining more than 10× speed-up compared to CPU-only set-ups. These results validate real-time diagnostic support as feasible even with mildly powerful hardware. The robust recall for cancerous cases (~94%) also validates the utility of the model towards reducing false negatives, an essential aspect of clinical diagnosis. In contrast to existing works, our methodology demonstrates a good trade-off between performance and computational overhead while refraining from using the overly complicated multi-network ensembles or all-transformer architectures to obtain comparable r esults. Nevertheless, a number of limitations and avenues to pursue exist. First, whereas BreakHis encompasses a heterogeneous dataset at four different magniﬁcations, actual clinical settings may introduce variability in stain, scanner hardware, and patient pop- ulations. Follow-on work will involve adding multi-institutional datasets to increase generalizability. Second, the model existing now conducts binary class prediction; exten- sions in the future will involve multi-class tumor type prediction (e.g., ductal, lobular, 332 E. Dupljak and E. Domazet in situ) to provide more ﬁne-grained insights. In addition, explainable AI methods (e.g.,"

In addition, explainable AI methods (e.g., Grad-CAM++, SHAP) might be incorporated more systematically to yield layer-wise rationales to aid clinician trust. Lastly, we also look to deploy our system on a real- time, browser-accessible clinical workstation—scaling our existing work to build a full interactive diagnosis aid tool for pathologists. 6 Conclusion This research presented a deep learning system for breast cancer histopathology image classiﬁcation using transfer learning and parallel preprocessing with GPUs. The system has high-performance classiﬁcation (94.8% accuracy and AUC of 0.973) and reduces compute costs signiﬁcantly using parallel data and model training. In comparison to other existing methods, the proposed technique presents a strong compromise between predictive performance, speed, and deploy ability. In addition to further validation on heterogeneous datasets and improvements in interpretability and clinical relevance, the technique has the promise to assist pathologists in real-time diagnosis and aid in early and accurate breast cancer detection.

As businesses strive to optimize productivity and efﬁciency, AI-driven technologies and automation platforms are increasingly being deployed at record levels. This change, which holds the promise of bringing substantial beneﬁts, has ignited ﬁerce arguments over its impacts, ranging from economic development and innovation to concerns of job loss, skill shortages, and ethical considerations. Reddit, a prominent social media platform, is an information treasure trove where individuals with diverse backgrounds post their opinions, experiences, and insights. The dynamic and free-ﬂowing character of the website provides an opportunity to detect pub- lic views and emerging themes on AI and automation in the workplace. It may be valuable for policymakers, business leaders, and educators to learn about these discussions as they confront the danger and opportunity presented by AI-driven change.

By natural language processing techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis, this study aims to detect the underlying topics, trends, and sentiment of public opinion. Its ﬁndings will provide practical insight into how society has embraced AI technologies, optimism towards innovation and fear of what it will bring in the long run. Ultimately, all this research is part of the debate around the future of work and what automation and AI will mean for it. 2 Literature Review The interaction between artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and automation within the workforce has inspired a growing level of interdisciplinary research into both its transformative power and social impact. Scholars noted that whereas AI technologies promise increased productivity as well as innovation, they also pose concerns regarding job loss, responsi- bility to ethics, and rising social inequalities [ 1, 2]. The inﬂuential volumes of McAfee and Brynjolfsson illustrate how the second machine age allows new modes of produc- tion and performance in the workforce [ 1]. Frey and Osborne depict the majority of careers—particularly ones with routine or predictable activities—being more exposed to automatization [2]. This twin axis of potentiality and peril is the core of the emerging debate on AI-induced change. Public opinion plays a central role in deciding the direction of AI uptake within soci- ety.

Jobin et al. provided a critical summary of guidelines on AI ethics and conveyed huge variety across global responses to reducing the risks and beneﬁting from AI [3]. Concur- rently, platforms like Reddit also offer a unique opportunity to research these views in real-time. Medvedev et al. demonstrated structural diversity of the Reddit communities and its suitability as a data source for the research of ﬁne-grained social controversies [4]. Natural language processing software is widely employed for such analysis. V ADER, for example, is a rule-based sentiment analysis model suitable for social media contexts [ 5]. Blei et al.’s Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a well-known method of extracting 336 I. Baholli et al. underlying topics in unstructured text corpora [ 6]. The methods have been used in stud- ies on the public’s response to AI on different platforms [ 7, 8]. Florenc Hidri and others have applied these techniques in a range of applications, including one study analyzing Twitter to analyze sentiment about Agile methodology and digital transformation [ 9] and another exploring online sentiment about tourism in Albania through Reddit-based sentiment and thematic analysis [10]. These studies demonstrate the value of combining emotional tone and thematic structure in the analysis of digital discourse.

Thematologically, some of the most common concerns in AI discourse are the poten- tial for mass unemployment and job replacement, the need for large reskilling and upskilling, and ethical measures to avoid risk factors such as algorithmic bias [ 11– 13]. Misuraca and van Noordt emphasized the need for AI governance frameworks, particularly in public sector implementations [ 14]. Further studies also explored how AI is perceived in the context of training and education. Cotton et al. discussed the manner in which tools like ChatGPT are altering what academic integrity and learning dynamics can expect [15]. Furthermore, soft skills like creativity, ﬂexibility, and emotional intelligence are also perceived as increasingly vital in an AI-expanded labor market [ 16, 17]. Despite these advances, there remain lacunae. Leskovec et al. cite that most data- driven surveys carried out on structured data lack the richness and contextuality of sen- timent found in spontaneous conversations [ 18]. Social media mining hence presents a contrasting view of public sentiment, especially in terms of innovation-led labor transitions. This study leverages these ﬁndings by analyzing more than 4,000 Reddit posts using sentiment analysis and topic modeling to uncover changing public narratives about AI and workforce transformation. It extends previous work by not only identifying the emotional tone of public discourse but also those themes that regulate public discourse regarding digital labor futures. ."

RQ2: What thematic issues are most frequently contested in Reddit threads about AI, automation, and employment? RQ3: How do public views convey concern or optimism about workforce adaptation, job displacement, and AI ethics? Based on preliminary observations and the literature, we developed the following hypotheses: H1: Overall positive sentiment dominates Reddit discussions on AI and automation in work. H2: Work, upskilling, and regulation are the most prevalent themes covered. H3: Negative sentiment is more strongly associated with themes of job displacement and ethics. Sentiment and Topic Dynamics in Reddit Discussions 337 4 Methodology 4.1 Data Source and Collection The information for the study was obtained from Reddit, a well-known public forum, selected for its topic-focused organized communities (subreddits) and availability of AI- themed discussion. Using the Reddit API and AsyncPRAW Python library, we obtained over 4,000 posts containing the keyword terms AI, automation, jobs, skills, upskilling, GPT, and future of work.

Text was cleaned by de-emojizing, de-linking, stripping of special characters, and stopwords. Normalization of text data was done using lowercasing, tokenization, and lemmatization. Non-English posts and spam posts were eliminated to improve topic coherence and sentiment accuracy. 4.3 Sentiment Analysis We employed the V ADER (V alence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) social media sentiment tool, which is tailored to analyze sentiment in social media. Every post was rated with the compound sentiment score and labeled as positive, negative, or neutral based on calibrated thresholds. 4.4 Topic Modeling In an effort to identify concealed themes, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) via the Gensim library in Python. LDA is a probabilistic model that recognizes underlying topics by clustering strongly co-occurring words in the corpus. Optimization was carried out based on coherence to determine the number of topics, and every topic was given a name depending on its top-ranked keywords and representative content. 4.5 Limitations As with most studies based on social media, there are several limitations that can be noted.

Second, although preprocessing processes were performed to reduce noise, there was some unwanted content (e.g., game or entertainment-related content) that appeared during topic modeling due to the heterogeneity of Reddit’s content. These were identiﬁed and eliminated through analysis. Third, Reddit lacks demographic data conﬁrmed (e.g., occupation, geographical location, age), which limits any subgroup analysis by user features. Fourth, while V ADER is widely used as a social media text sentiment analysis tool, it may struggle to recognize sarcasm, irony, and mixed or conﬂicting sentiments, which may affect sentiment classiﬁcation accuracy. Fifth, Reddit’s inherent moderation 338 I. Baholli et al. practices, social culture, and potential echo chamber effects can bring site-speciﬁc bias to bear on the conversation.

The visibility of topics surrounding professional certiﬁcation and governed data governance reﬂects a public shift of focus toward preparedness and regulation—hallmarks of responsible AI deployment. Conversely, the intrusion of game and unrelated entertainment topics into the dataset served to bring into focus how far-reaching discussions on AI are and how pertinent ﬁltering should be. Collectively, the results of these studies suggest an engaged, forward-looking public. The optimism is broad based, yet the concerns registered suggest that the workforce is aware of AI not just as an instrument of expansion, but also as a challenge to be solved with caution, openness, and inclusiveness. 7 Conclusion This study contributes to the understanding of public opinion about AI and automation, particularly in online forums. By conducting sentiment analysis and topic modeling of more than 4,000 Reddit posts, we found that optimism about AI’s potential is followed by signiﬁcant concern about its socio-economic and ethical implications.

The capacity to forecast student performance has emerged as an essen- tial instrument for educational institutions seeking to promote success and tackle issues preemptively. This work investigates the application of machine learning models, particularly Random Forest classiﬁers, to classify student ﬁnal grades into three categories: Low, Medium, and High. The model discovers critical vari- ables, including study time, prior grades, and familial relationships, by exam- ining a dataset comprising academic, demographic, and behavioral factors. The ﬁndings indicate elevated classiﬁcation accuracy, providing meaningful data for educators to customize treatments.

One of the most dominant techniques of predicting academic success is machine learning (ML). Ayoubi, et al. [5] pointed out that ML models (such as RF, SVM, and neu- ral networks) can deal with multidimensional input and may identify the nonlinear rela- tionships among predictors. These equations do not just predict outcomes; they reveal what matters most for achieving in school. Previous academic achievement, study habits, attendance, and socioeconomic status often emerge as important predictors of student success [ 4, 10]. Educators can apply this knowledge to develop targeted interventions to meet the individual requirements of kids, thus enhancing outcomes. The predictive value of predicting educational success goes beyond individual stu- dents. Predictive models are also used by institutions to identify trends to inform policies, allocate resources and develop programming [ 12, 16, 18]. It also enables the early iden- tiﬁcation of children at risk of school failure, so that schools may intervene early in the school life of these children, with time to use effective interventions, such as tutoring and counseling that have been shown to produce large gains for students [ 20].

Predicting Academic Performance 345 Machine learning has transformed education, it has enabled educators to look at big and complex data sets more accurately. SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Network models have been increasingly used for predicting student performance. Studies show that they perform better than common statistical methods such as linear regression in learning non-linear relationships among variables [ 5, 6]. Feature selection may have played a fundamental role in academic performance prediction. Prior studies have reported other prospective indicators, for example, prior academic achievement, study attitudes, attendance, and socioeconomic status [ 10, 21]. Highlighted the value of behavioral features such as participation in extracurricular activities and time management in predicting students’ academic performance. The importance of parent’s involvement and support has also been well demonstrated in various studies [ 9–11]. One of the main barriers in this area is the issue of data quality. Deﬁcient or biased datasets may result in wrong expectations and propagate existing aberrations [ 8]. Researchers have recommended different techniques to handle these challenges, including data ascription and standardization [ 13]. Another problem con- cerns the moral implications of using predictive algorithms in teaching. Taking care of privacy and fairness in algorithmic decision making is crucial [ 2, 7, 17, 22]."

Despite these barriers, the potential beneﬁts of predictive analytics in education are substantial. An immediate identiﬁcation of at-risk teenagers enables teachers to make immediate interventions, such as mentoring, discern and counseling and peer coaching [ 12]. Predictive models aid in maximizing the allocation of resources for institutions and in the design of more fertile educational programs. Adoption of predictive analytics in identifying learning deﬁciencies and tailoring instructional strategies accordingly: Smith and Brown in 2018 presented a study on how predictive analytics could be applied for identifying learning deﬁciencies and tailoring instructions strategies [ 20]. A promising research space is to combine NLP with forecasting models. Different NLP techniques were applied on an assortment of information like student presentations, discussion boards, and social media engagements to extract information related to their scholastic and mental health [ 14]. Such schemes provide an overall analysis of student’s performance that goes beyond standard measures like grades or attendance ratios.

Further still, the integration of ethical principles in predictive analytics is still a largely untouched area of research. Prediction of academic success is an area where machine learning has the potential to be revolutionary [ 3]. Nonetheless, actualizing this promise necessitates tackling the issues of data quality, ethical implications, and the demand for more thorough and inclusive research. This project seeks to enhance existing research by creating a reliable and ethical machine learning model to forecast student grades, offering practical insights for educators and policymakers. 346 N.

The mathematical representation of Random Forest is expressed by Eq.

Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data (bootstrap sample), and random feature selection at each split ensures diversity and reduces overﬁtting. 3.3 Support V ector Machine (SVM) SVM aims to ﬁnd the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes while maximizing the margin between them [6, 23].

The kernel function dependence of SVM, for example, RBF, allows it to process nonlinear patterns; nevertheless, it may continue to ﬁnd difﬁculty with edge cases (Fig. 2). The confusion matrix of Logistic Regression indicates its performance as a baseline model. It performs reasonably well for “Medium” grades but ﬁnds it harder for “Low” and “High” categories because of its linear decision boundary. Misclassiﬁcations are more than in Random Forest and SVM, indicating the insufﬁciency of the model in solving complicated relationships in the dataset.

However, much of the literature still relies on traditional regression models or lacks real-time responsiveness, leaving room for improvement in both predictive accuracy and experimental reproducibility. In response to these gaps, this study presents a comparative analysis of multiple mod- ern regression algorithms including Decision Tree [ 6], LightGBM [ 7]. Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting [ 8] applied to trip duration prediction using real-world NYC taxi trip data. Building on insights from existing work, we emphasize the importance of feature engineering by incorporating derived variables such as pickup and drop-off zones, and temporal features like pickup day and hour. Additionally, to address the often- overlooked need for transparent, reproducible experimentation, we employ MLﬂow [ 9] as an experiment tracking and management tool. This ensures that model parameters, metrics, and code versions are consistently recorded, facilitating rigorous comparison and replication. The objectives of this study are as follows: • Utilizing regression models to predict trip duration based on key factors like trip distance, spatiotemporal distribution of pickups/drop-offs and temporal features like pickup_day • Analyse and compare the performance of Decision Tree Regressor, LightGBM Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor."

The work from [ 13] demonstrated that while lin- ear regression captures some variance, advanced models like Gradient Boosting reduce RMSE from around 4.5 to 3.3 min. However, many models still lack real-time inputs like live trafﬁc or events, which limits their predictive responsiveness. Linear regression as a traditional approach remains a widely-used baseline for taxi trip predictions due to its simplicity and interpretability.

By utilizing MLﬂow, researchers can focus more on interpreting and improving models, conﬁdent that the experimental details are captured for posterity and peer veriﬁcation. This level of experiment tracking and management contributes to more reliable and transparent ML research outcomes. While most of the existing literature focuses on model development and feature engineering, few studies integrate an experiment tracking tool like MLﬂow. Our study addresses this gap by bringing transparency and structure to model comparison and reproducibility. 3 Data and Preprocessing This study uses the New Y ork City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Green Taxi Trip Records [ 16], a total of 305205 records and 21 vars/attributes. The dataset contains trip-level records of green taxi rides, including timestamps, locations, fare components, payment details, and trip distances. We employed data from July-December 2024 and split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing. Each record includes pickup and dropoff times and locations, passenger count, trip distance, fare amounts, and additional charges such as tolls, tips, congestion, and improvement surcharges.

Trips with invalid or extreme values were removed by ﬁltering trips with durations less than 1 min or greater than 60 min. Categorical location IDs were converted to string types for subsequent processing. Additional temporal features such as pickup hour, day of the week, month, and weekend indicator were engineered, alongside derived features like a combined pickup-dropoff location (PU_DO) and a time-of-day category. Outlier trips were identiﬁed and excluded based on trip duration constraints (1–60 min), effectively removing records likely corresponding to data errors or anomalies. 356 L. Berberi et al. We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the NYC taxi trip data, enabling us to better understand the relationships between trip distances across different times and days.

New features were created such as the pickup hour, pickup month, whether the trip occurred on a weekend, a combined pickup and drop-off location feature (PU_DO), and a time-of-day category. These additional features aimed to provide the models with contextual information that could inﬂuence trip duration predictions. Furthermore, we evaluated the feature importance using a fast method combining correlation analysis for numerical features and variance-based scores for categorical fea- tures, ﬁnding that fare_amount, and total_amount have higher predictive importance for trip duration, while trip_distance (used for the baseline approach) shows low signiﬁcance likely because travel time can vary for the same distance due to trafﬁc conditions. For model training, the input features were separated into numerical and cate- gorical groups. The numerical features selected are fare_amount, total_amount and trip_distance These were preprocessed using a pipeline that applied median imputa- tion for missing values, followed by standard scaling.

A limitation of this study lies in the exclusion of environmental factors such as weather conditions for the analysis period (July–December 2024). Given that weather is a well-documented determinant of urban travel behavior, its absence may have inﬂuenced model performance and predictive reliability, particularly during adverse conditions or seasonal ﬂuctuations. To address this, future research will incorporate weather-related variables sourced from NYC open data platforms, enabling a more comprehensive mod- eling framework that accounts for real-time environmental inﬂuences.

Traditional systems for forecasting such as ARIMA have done and continue to do the job quite well. Box et al. (2015) analyzed ARIMA ’s skill in estimating linear relationships, but as noted by others, it does not deal very well when it comes to non-linear and non-stationary data [ 3]. Machine learning approaches have emerged as solutions to these problems because they offer greater ﬂexibility and accuracy [ 4]. Breiman (2001), Random Forest has shown to be useful in healthcare, ﬁnance, and education [4]. It has also been shown to excel in handling large datasets containing numer- ous interacting features such as in predicting student performance where it addresses both categorical and continuous factors [9].

Support V ector Machines (SVM) [9] came into the picture in 1995 through a publi- cation by Cortes and V apnik and have since built a good reputation for dealing with clas- siﬁcation and regression problems. SVM is known to have a very powerful kernel-based approach to non-linear relations [ 6]. Recent work has applied SVMs to educational datasets, proving their ability to predict student performance based on behavioral and academic metrics [ 5]. The selection of hyperparameters such as the kernel type and the regularization parameter has a great impact on performance [ 20]. k-NN, a simple yet robust algorithm, was introduced in 1967 by Cover and Hart. It has been used in time series forecasting due to its ability to detect local trends. However, ML-Based Time Series Prediction of Student Academic Performance 373 the sensitivity of k-NN to noise and its high computational costs for large datasets remain problematic [12]. Current attempts to improve k-NN with advanced distance calculations and feature selection have shown promise in addressing these issues [ 22].

Advancements in deep learning recently have dramatically improved the tools acces- sible for time series forecasting.

BERT and its derivatives, among other Transformer models, have been studied in the context of time series data, presenting a novel solution for the complication of managing long-term dependencies. Research in the last several years has also highlighted the potential of transfer learn- ing.

This dataset comprises information regarding students’ academic performance, gathered from a varied school setting. Essen- tial characteristics encompass demographic data (e.g., gender, nationality, birthplace), academic attributes (e.g., educational stage, grade level, ﬁeld of study), behavioral met- rics (e.g., instances of raised hands, quantity of resources accessed, engagement in dis- cussions), and parental involvement (e.g., survey feedback, satisfaction with the school). The target variable, designated as “Class,” classiﬁes student performance into three tiers: High (H), Medium (M), and Low (L). The dataset consists of 16 attributes and 480 records, which were preprocessed to rectify missing values and standardize categorical variables.

Random Forest mitigates overﬁtting by the aggregation of several trees and has considerable efﬁcacy in managing extensive, high-dimensional datasets [4]. The prediction of a Random Forest is given by equation ( 1): ˆy = 1 T T t=1 ft(x) (1) where T is the number of trees, ft(x) is the prediction from the t-th tree, and ˆy is the ﬁnal prediction. 3.4 Support V ector Machine (SVM) Support V ector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning technique designed to iden- tify the best hyperplane that distinguishes data points of various classes within a high- dimensional space.

For regression, the prediction is expressed by equation ( 4): ˆy = 1 k k i=1 yi (4) where yi are the values of the k nearest neighbors.

Conventional work- force classiﬁcation approaches frequently depend on manual sorting processes, admin- istrative policies, and subjective assessments, potentially resulting in job misallocation, inefﬁciencies, and workload disparities [ 9]. The inefﬁciencies are intensiﬁed by rising demand for healthcare services, population expansion, and resource limitations in both public and commercial health institutions in Kenya [ 10]. As a result, machine learning (ML)-based classiﬁcation methods have become prominent in workforce management, offering data-driven decision-making capabilities to improve job role assignments [2, 7, 12]. Machine learning strategies, including Decision Trees, RF and Neural Networks, have appeared signiﬁcant efﬁcacy in categorizing and predicting differing workforce disseminations within healthcare frameworks [ 5].

Classiﬁcation of Healthcare Workers 383 3 Data and Methodology 3.1 Data The healthcare workforce in Kenya has experienced substantial expansion and evo- lution in the last ten years. The Health Labour Market Analysis for Kenya indicates that the nation has nearly doubled its health workforce, now totaling approximately 190,000 active health professionals across 13 principal health occupations, including nurses, midwives, physicians, surgeons, and various specialists [ 1]. Notwithstanding this advancement, Kenya encounters difﬁculties in achieving the advised health worker- to-population ratios. The World Health Organization (WHO) advises a minimum of 4.45 healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and midwives, per 1,000 indi- viduals to attain fundamental health coverage [ 16]. According to the most recent data, Kenya’s population density remains below this level, signifying a necessity for ongoing investment in the increase and dispersion of the health staff. The health workforce in Kenya is primarily composed of nurses and midwives, representing about 57.7% of the total health staff, consistent with regional patterns noted throughout Africa [ 1]. The residual workforce consists of physicians, clinical ofﬁcers,"

The residual workforce consists of physicians, clinical ofﬁcers, pharmacists, laboratory technicians, and other allied health professionals. Kenya yearly generates approximately 8,200 healthcare professionals through training and education. Forecasts suggest that by 2031, the overall count of healthcare professionals in the nation is anticipated to exceed 270,000, provided that current training and recruiting rates persist [ 1]. Nonetheless, discrepancies are evident in the allocation of these specialists, with rural and underdeveloped regions facing more pronounced shortages. The Health Labour Market Analysis identiﬁes difﬁculties like the movement of health workers, both domestically and internationally, which impacts retention and the general availability of qualiﬁed professionals. Initiatives are being implemented to resolve these challenges via policy reforms, enhanced working conditions, and incentives designed to retain healthcare professionals in the public sector and neglected areas [ 1]. The WHO has underscored the necessity of incorporating digital health initiatives and workforce planning technologies to facilitate a more equal allocation of healthcare personnel across various regions [13–16].

Subsequent study ought to investigate machine learning applications in workforce forecasts and data-driven policy interventions to enhance Kenya’s healthcare system [ 16]. 3.2 Decision Tree The Decision Tree Classiﬁer was used as the primary model for classifying healthcare workers based on their job roles. A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that predicts categorical outcomes by recursively splitting the dataset based on feature values. It operates using a tree-like structure, where internal nodes represent decision rules, branches indicate outcomes of those rules, and leaf nodes represent ﬁnal classiﬁcations. 384 H. Alkattan et al. The core of the Decision Tree algorithm relies on impurity measures such as the Gini Index or Entropy. In this study, the Gini Index was used as the splitting criterion, which is deﬁned as Eq. ( 1): Gini = 1 − n i=1 p2 i (1) where pi is the proportion of instances belonging to class i in a given node. The Decision Tree selects the feature and threshold that minimize the Gini Index, thereby ensuring that the child nodes are as pure as possible. The Information Gain (IG) is another key concept in Decision Trees, used to determine the best feature for splitting. It is deﬁned by Eq. ( 2): IG = H (P) − H (P| A)(2)"

( 2): IG = H (P) − H (P| A)(2) where H (P) represents the entropy before the split, and H (PA) is the entropy after the split based on feature A. Entropy, a measure of disorder in the dataset, is calculated by Eq. (3): H (P) = − n i=1 pilog 2pi (3) A Decision Tree grows until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth (d), a minimum number of samples per split (n), or a pure node where all instances belong to one class. The ﬁnal prediction for a given sample follows the path from the root node to a leaf node, based on the feature values. To prevent overﬁtting, pruning techniques such as pre-pruning (limiting tree depth) and post-pruning (removing branches with low predictive power) were applied. The model was trained on a preprocessed dataset, ensuring balance in class distribution, and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The decision function for classifying a new sample x in a Decision Tree can be represented as Eq.

Classiﬁcation of Healthcare Workers 385 4 Results The decision tree depicts a systematic strategy for categorizing healthcare professionals according to their characteristics, including age, experience, and salary level. The method commences with a root node that initiates a division based on age, recommending that more youthful healthcare professionals are transcendently categorized as nurses, though older people need extra distinction based on experience and compensation. This funda- mental division underscores the signiﬁcance of age in labor categorization, as it acts as a crucial determinant of career headway and specialization. As the tree creates, additional decision nodes arise, upgrading the classiﬁcation based on experience and salary.

In contrast, those with lesser experience are more as often as possible categorized as nurses or technicians, indicative of the standard career progression within the healthcare industry. The com- pensation level may be a critical impact, particularly in separating administrators from clinical staff. People with elevated salaries are more frequently categorized as chairmen, showing that salary serves as a strong indicator of regulatory positions inside the dataset. Moreover, certain divisions propose that technicians and nurses can be recognized by a combination of wage and experience criteria. This indicates that the decision tree precisely reﬂects ﬁnancial and experience advancement inside the healthcare industry, comparing with genuine employment systems. Leaf nodes in A DT mean ultimate classi- ﬁcations, with each direction from the root hub to a leaf reﬂecting a distinct combination of feature values that come full circle in a classiﬁcation choice.

The recall displays the model’s proﬁciency in accurately recognizing each class from all genuine instances of that class. Recall is computed as the ratio of accurately predicted instances to the total actual instances in the dataset. The Nurse role exhibits the highest recall, indicating that the model accurately recognized the majority of actual nurses.

Out of these, 1000 employee samples were for the study. Data classiﬁcation is a necessary and important job that is required in many industries including the higher education ﬁeld. The proper splitting of the data in the higher education sector is the key element for making the right decisions about the staff members, as well as about the allocation of the resources and shaping of the program as the right staff in the institutions [ 1–7].

Bayesian methods target the hypothesis probabilities directly [ 1–3]. The act of focusing and directing the attention of researchers and technologists and the application of various techniques such as machine learning in different industries and trying to make a difference were the main issues.

Manual diagnosis of anemia types such as iron deﬁciency anemia, thalassemia minor, and anemia of chronic disease typ- ically requires specialized testing and expert interpretation, which can be time- consuming and costly. In this work, we develop and compare machine learning models to classify anemia based on routine blood test biomarkers. We leverage a large clinical dataset of complete blood count values such as HGB, HCT, RBC indices, and Ferritin from 9,711 patients. After preprocessing and feature selec- tion using XGBoost importance, we retain six key features such as HGB, MCV , and Ferritin. We then train and evaluate multiple classiﬁcation models: Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and a Multi- layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Ensemble models, particularly Random Forest, achieved the highest accuracy and weighted F1 scores on the test set. While slightly trailing in performance, Logistic Regression emerged as the most cost- efﬁcient model due to its minimal computational requirements and straightforward interpretability, which are key advantages for clinical settings where resources and transparency are critical. These ﬁndings demonstrate that machine learning applied to basic blood biomarkers can provide accurate, scalable, and accessible support for anemia detection and classiﬁcation."

Its prevalence is especially high in low- and middle-income countries, where nutritional deﬁciencies and limited healthcare access contribute to rates exceeding 30 to 40% among vulnerable groups [ 1, 3]. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026 K.

Clinically, anemia is deﬁned by a decrease in the concentration of hemoglobin or red blood cells, which affects the blood’s ability to carry oxygen and frequently results in symptoms including exhaustion, pallor, and lightheadedness [ 4]. However, in many chronic cases, anemia may remain asymptomatic and go undetected without laboratory screening [5]. The most common diagnostic method is the complete blood count (CBC), a widely available and cost-effective test that provides several key hematological indices including hemoglobin level, hematocrit, RBC count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) ["

These features help classify anemia into subtypes such as microcytic (often due to iron deﬁciency), normocytic (associated with chronic disease), and macrocytic (typically caused by vitamin B12 or folate deﬁciency) [ 7]. Additional markers like ferritin can further pinpoint iron-deﬁciency anemia, but such tests may be unavailable or costly in resource-limited settings [ 8]. Given the clinical importance of early and accurate anemia detection, and the limi- tations of conventional diagnostic workﬂows, particularly where manual interpretation introduces delays or errors, machine learning (ML) offers a compelling alternative. ML algorithms can process complex, multidimensional data from routine blood tests to detect anemia and even distinguish among its subtypes [ 9]. Several studies have demonstrated the efﬁcacy of ML approaches, reporting classiﬁcation accuracies above 97% using models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks on CBC-based datasets [ 10, 11]. This study builds on prior research by providing a comprehensive comparison of ML algorithms for anemia diagnosis and subtype classiﬁcation using blood biomarker data.

The data includes complete blood count (CBC) measurements, biochemical markers, and demographic information. After ﬁltering for rows with valid diagnostic labels, 9,711 records were retained, each classiﬁed into one of the following ﬁve categories: (1) No anemia with 7,694 samples, Machine Learning-Driven Anemia Diagnosis 407 (2) Anemia of Chronic Disease (ACD) with 1,682 samples, (3) Megaloblastic Anemia (suspect) with 148 samples, (4) Iron Deﬁciency Anemia (IDA) with 107 samples and (5) Thalassemia Minor (suspect) with 80 samples. The records that did not ﬁt this ﬁlter were removed. To improve data reliability, features containing unreliable or ambiguous informa- tion such as ﬂag annotations and machine-generated mean values were excluded. After cleaning, 68 informative features remained. 3.3 Data Preprocessing Prior to feature selection or modeling, the dataset was cleaned and transformed through the following pipeline.

A small number of missing values were found in speciﬁc columns (e.g. PDW(fL) and PCT(%)). Rather than discarding samples, missing values were ﬁlled using median imputation tailored to the feature’s distribution, preserving data integrity and size. The same procedure was followed with Ferritin where missing values were ﬁlled with gender medians, all within the normal range. Label Encoding. The target variable Final Diagnosis was encoded numerically from 0 to 4 for modeling purposes, as noted in Sect. 3.2. One-Hot Encoding. The gender ﬁeld was encoded into Gender_f and Gender_m. Only Gender_f was retained to reduce multicollinearity and preserve interpretability, since gender is binary and the encoding is symmetric. Normalization. All numerical features were normalized using min-max scaling, which transforms the data to a ﬁxed range between 0 and 1. This step was essential to ensure uniformity across features and prevent any single feature from dominating others, espe- cially important for distance-based models like K-Nearest Neighbors and gradient-based models like Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). 3.4 Feature Importance To identify the most informative features for anemia classiﬁcation, we employed XGBoost, a high-performance gradient boosting framework known for its accuracy and embedded feature selection capabilities.

Fig- ures 2 and 3 present boxplots and violin plots that reveal meaningful and clinically con- sistent patterns across the diagnostic classes. HGB(g/dL) and Ferritin are signiﬁcantly lower in Iron Deﬁciency Anemia (IDA) and Megaloblastic Anemia, as expected. Ferritin reﬂects iron storage and is critical in distinguishing IDA. MCV(fL) and MCH(pg) show characteristic trends for different anemia types. Low values in IDA and Thalassemia minor reﬂect microcytic anemia, whereas elevated levels in Megaloblastic Anemia indi- cate macrocytic anemia, often linked to B12 or folate deﬁciency. IG%(%), while not traditionally used in anemia screening, shows increased variability in ACD and Mega- loblastic Anemia, suggesting possible links to inﬂammation or bone marrow response.

A correlation heatmap is shown on Fig. 5 to examine relation- ships between the six selected features. As expected, MCV(fL) and MCH(pg) were strongly correlated (r = 0.90), reﬂecting their shared role in red blood cell morphology. HGB(g/dL) showed moderate correlation with MCH(pg) (r = 0.33) and a weaker link to MCV(fL) (r = 0.14). Ferritin had a very low correlation with any of the other features, highlighting its role as a distinct biomarker for iron storage rather than red cell char- acteristics.

The strong per- formance of tree-based models and neural networks shows that even with a limited number of features, accurate classiﬁcation is achievable. The inclusion of both mor- phological (e.g., MCV , MCH) and biochemical markers (Ferritin) contributed to strong performance across distinct anemia subtypes.

While results were excellent, the dataset was derived solely from laboratory data. This excludes factors such as patient history, symptoms and medications, which clinicians typically use alongside lab results. Incorporating such context could further improve diagnostic accuracy and decision-making utility. 6 Conclusion This study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in diagnosing anemia subtypes using routine complete blood count (CBC) data and a limited set of key biomarkers.

The selected features, such as hemoglobin, MCH, MCV , and ferritin, were not only statistically relevant but also clinically interpretable, reinforcing the utility of data-driven approaches in hematology. Future research should extend this framework in several directions. First, integrating patient history, including symptoms (e.g., fatigue, pallor), dietary patterns, previous diagnoses, and medication use could enrich model inputs and improve performance, especially in edge cases. Combining structured lab data with unstructured clinical notes or EHR ﬁelds through natural language processing (NLP) is a promising avenue. Secondly, prospective validation in clinical settings is needed to assess model gen- eralizability and user trust. Real-time deployment trials with clinician feedback could help reﬁne model outputs and interfaces. Disclosure of Interests. The author declares no conﬂict of interest. 422 A. Xhepaliu et al.

Three machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest have been utilized and compared against accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The outcome shows that the best was 80.5% accuracy, the best precision was 79.1%, the best recall was 81.3%, and the best F1 score was 80.2% using Random Forest due to its superior handling of non-linear relationships and feature interactions. The outcome shows that the most effective approach for modeling non-linear and complex relations between data and consumer behavior would be to employ ensemble approaches utilizing the application of Random Forest. This study offers practical insights for CRM- related predictive modeling and provides an application of the use of machine learning to accomplish maximum retention and maximize campaign best.

With orga- nizations amassing and storing more signiﬁcant volumes of web interactions, business transactions, and service requests, their ability to take this type of data on board and pro- cess it as part of business decision-making has become necessary. Since these machine models can process much data and recognize complex trends, they have worked effec- tively in these situations [1]. Based on these models, organizations can forecast areas of behavior among customers that include buying behavior, satisfaction, or churn behavior. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026 K.

Predictions of consumer behavior due to the rise of usage of CRM solutions like Salesforce are undergoing a sea change. The solutions allow companies to capture and track conversations from social media, email, and other digital and non-digital sources and give them a 360-degree picture of the consumer. Using predictive analytics capa- bilities of machine learning-based tools capabilities, companies get to know more about the likes and dislikes of the consumer and take corrective action immediately. Predic- tive models can detect potential customers at risk of churn, and companies can take corrective action in the form of consumer service or provide more offers to help them remain customers. Customer service and business engagement can be revolutionized using machine learning models of CRM solutions [ 2]. The reason behind such studies is that predictive analytics in CRM applications becomes increasingly pertinent to business growth and customer retention. Customer driver behaviors are a top priority, and companies are attempting to minimize churn and ensure high customer satisfaction. Customer churn forecasting is a problem in such a ﬁeld and, unresolved, has a direct negative effect on revenue and growth.

Several prominent studies have found that machine learning models can be used in CRM environments, speciﬁcally in churn prediction [3]. One interesting emerging area has been using decision trees and ensemble Predicting Customer Behavior 425 methods such as random forests to identify customers with high propensities to churn and those with low propensities to not churn [6, 7]. The typical work involves using a set of attributes such as the purchasing history, customer data, and service usage patterns to build models to predict [ 4–7]. Another prominent thread in the literature has been using neural networks and deep learning methods, particularly in the context where traditional models perform sub-optimally [ 6]. Building upon these ﬁndings, subsequent research has explored regression models. Recent studies have employed using regression models to forecast customers’ behaviors with a particular interest in customer lifetime value (CL V) analysis. The regression models have been used to take advantage of past data to pre-determine the future value of the customers and optimize resource allocation [ 8].

It can generally be done using unsupervised machine learning methods such as k-means clustering to categorize cus- tomers based on behaviors and characteristics into clusters. The clusters can be targeted with focused marketing. Integration with installed customer relationship management systems such as Salesforce has been used in research to provide real-time automation in predicting and analyzing customer behaviors [ 9]. Despite many contributions to customer behavior prediction by prior research, there are currently several limitations. One limitation is using simple features such as demo- graphics or history in purchases without employing more complex or ﬁne-grained behav- ioral features [ 9, 10]. This limitation generally results in poor predictive models or not capturing all customer behaviors. Another limitation in most studies is concentration on a single facet, i.e., churn, with other customer behaviors such as engagement, purchase behavior, or opportunity to upsell equally critical to businesses. Another limitation of studies is the lack of real-time application. While predictive models generally get built from history, they do not always get deployed in real-time systems that can react to chang- ing customer behaviors in real-time. This deﬁciency in dynamic prediction systems is a signiﬁcant area for improvement [ 10]. Another shortcoming is interpretability. Some advanced machine learning tech-"

Some advanced machine learning tech- niques, such as deep learning, are usually “black boxes,” and companies do not always know how predictions are generated [ 11]. This transparency issue can deter use in CRM systems where decision-makers need understandable, actionable information [ 12, 13]. Further, most research does not discuss considerations for the ethical use of customer data, for example, data bias and privacy. There is extensive literature on the application of machine learning to be utilized in CRM research to be undertaken within such work, i.e., predictive and modeling from client/customer activity. Literature gaps have demonstrated that research is yet to be conducted. For instance, less literature has dealt with applications within usage as it happens in CRM applications such as Salesforce to respond and predict client/customer activity undertaken. Such a gap elucidated, for instance, through simple features, non- real-time predictively, and non-interpretable ability within complex models, provides bases on which research questions within such an existing research study are posed.

A comparative experimental research design is required to compare machine learning models against an inputted telco Cus- tomer Churn dataset. It is best suited to solve the research problem because it allows systematic comparison and testing of forecasting models against client activity data and evaluates their performance and accuracy to forecast churn and evaluate different models against various performances simultaneously using several different algorithmic inputs whose performances are easily quantiﬁable to identify causes and effects of client churn and other activities, something that would be difﬁcult to ascertain through solely qual- itative research. Experimental design is a straightforward means of identifying the use of machine learning against CRM systems, particularly automating client engagement decision-making. 3.2 Framework The research design involves the application of machine learning models to forecast the churn of customers, giving high priority to supervised learning models such as Logistic"

Data preprocessing involves cleansing the data, ﬁlling in missing values, and encoding categorical features. It proceeds to variable selection to select variables that have the maximum impact on the churn of customers, such as tenure, monthly charges, and payment mode. Data are partitioned into training sets and testing sets so that models learn from part of the former and are evaluated on unseen sets to estimate if they can learn from sets observed earlier. Cross-validation machine learning approaches are applied to the train- ing and testing of machine learning models to avoid overﬁtting and obtain valid perfor- mance. With the successful completion of the models’ training, predictive performance may be evaluated using accuracy, precision-recall, and F1 score. The best-performing predictive model would be obtained and identiﬁed to study further and recommend actions. A ﬂowchart of the procedure to this effect is initiated by collecting data and preprocessing the data. It proceeds to build, assess, and select the best predictive model. 3.3 Data Analysis and Collection Data from this project’s primary source is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which is obtainable freely from open sources such as Kaggle and placed in the public domain.

Once data collection is done, various processes are to be carried out to analyze the data. Such processes include exploratory data analysis (EDA) to facilitate checking the variable distribution, relation or correlation, or otherwise of the variables and the occurrence of outlier values within the data set. V arious learning machines perform predictive modeling, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The models are used because they are best suited to solve classiﬁcation problems, and their performances are easily comparable. Data preprocessing, model construction, and evaluation are achieved using Python and libraries like Scikit-learn and Pandas. The models are trained against training sets and evaluated against the use of test sets. Their performance is achieved through standard classiﬁcation measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 3.4 Limitations and Assumptions Bidirectional Customer records from the Customer Churn from the Telco Customer Churn dataset are assumed to represent some more extensive universe of businesses.

Records outside this are assumed to be relatively clean, with the problem of missing val- ues and outliers taken care of during preprocessing. Customer behavior records from data from the data set are also assumed to be ﬁne-grained enough to use to make predictions about churn with good enough accuracy. There are several limits to the methodology taken, though. Firstly, the study here is bounded by the scope and quality of the data sets used. While good data are available in the Telco dataset, situations arise whereby all drivers to churn are not included in data (e.g., exogenous events, i.e., market and business conditions or opinions on the client’s part). Such a study here looks at supervised algorithms only and not those supervised and the understanding they can provide on customer data (e.g., subject matter models). Another limitation of the models and study used here is the use of past data to train models whereby accuracy is compromised if business conditions change or client behavior changes over time. With all such assumptions made, the methodology provides a good enough structure to experiment with machine learning approaches in CRM data. 4 Experiments, Results, and Discussion 4.1 Experimental Setup We performed the experiment using a Python environment and various machine learning libraries and implemented their applications using sci-kit-learn and pandas for handling the data.

Although Random Forest takes the high score when it comes to the identiﬁcation of churn activity, precluding the occurrence of non-churn customers misclassiﬁed as churn customers from being given is still an issue.

The hypothesis that ensemble-based algorithms and, mainly, Random Forest are more suited to learn the customer activity data having nonlinearity and complex relations is conﬁrmed as evidence of current work. Companies can enhance customer retention efforts by leveraging Random Forest models for churn prediction. Random Forest can effectively classify high probability to churn customers and help design a successful churn policy. This performance may be attributed to Random Forest’s ability to handle non-linear patterns and feature interactions more effectively than simpler models.

Organizations would have to prioritize improving data collection and quality because quality data helps ensure predictions with accuracy. Despite positive outcomes from the churn prediction aspect, the study has many drawbacks. First, the dataset is from one telecom business and may not represent large industries or consumer trends. Consequently, the use of the model may be isolated where businesses have different consumer habits in other sectors. However, the use of past consumer habits and the models may be hindered from forecasting behavior when there is a change in market or consumer needs.

This study explores an automated machine learning-based metadata classiﬁcation and management approach, integrating DBpedia’s structured ontol- ogy with NLP-enabled models. The suggested methodology adopts TF-IDF, Word2V ec, and BERT-based classiﬁcation, achieving 92.4% accuracy, a 24% improvement over traditional methods, and a 40% reduction in processing time. The system was trained on 80% of DBpedia’s dataset and evaluated using F1- score (0.93) and efﬁciency metrics. Results indicate deep learning models perform better than rule-based and keyword-based systems to ensure higher metadata con- sistency and real-time classiﬁcation. This study presents a scalable AI-powered metadata framework with potential applications in digital libraries, knowledge retrieval systems, and enterprise data management. Future studies will enhance model adaptability, reduce computational requirements, and improve dynamic ontology updates for evolving metadata environments.

Traditional approaches, such as rule-based classiﬁcation and manual metadata annotation, are time- consuming, error-prone, and difﬁcult to scale with data growth. As machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques advance, automatic classiﬁca- tion has emerged as a potential approach to enhance accuracy, efﬁciency, and consistency in metadata management [ 1]. The DBpedia Ontology Dataset, a semantically structured knowledge base derived from Wikipedia, provides a valuable resource for training ML models to classify and manage metadata efﬁciently. 1.1 Justiﬁcation for Addressing the Research Problem Organizations and researchers increasingly rely on massive amounts of structured and unstructured data for varied applications such as information retrieval, content recom- mendation, and semantic search.

Traditional metadata tagging methods have an accuracy of less than 65%, and it is challenging to guarantee high-quality data classiﬁcation. The need for a viable machine learning-based solution to automate metadata extraction and classiﬁcation is more critical than ever. 1.2 Speciﬁc Problem Deﬁnition and Research Gap Despite the advances in supervised learning and natural language processing, metadata classiﬁcation still faces scalability, precision, and applicability challenges to varying domains. Most existing solutions can only deal with unstructured or structured data, but not with a generalized solution that also leverages semantic knowledge graphs for improved classiﬁcation. The primary research gap is the lack of a practical, scalable ML- based framework that can classify entities and deal with metadata with high accuracy without signiﬁcant human involvement. 1.3 Signiﬁcance and Relevance of the Study This study is pertinent as it explores machine-learning techniques to enhance metadata consistency, classiﬁcation accuracy, and retrieval efﬁciency.

The latest technologies have included using machine learning (ML) algorithms in structured data, for example, in the DBpedia Ontology, to ensure such processes are efﬁcient and accurate. Several studies have focused on the overlap between ML and web technologies for enriching data categorization and metadata. For instance, a data-driven methodology for the semi-automatic construction of knowledge graphs using tools available for the smooth fusion of diverse data sources [ 1, 2] was put forward. The automated construc- tion of knowledge graphs is the focus of such methodology to ensure enhanced data organization and retrieval. 2.2 Key Approaches in Earlier Studies The integration of ML and semantic web technologies has been a focus area in recent research. The data-driven method of constructing a knowledge graph is a semi-automatic way to create knowledge graphs and optimize data retrieval and integration [ 1–4]. The approach utilizes available tools to automate the construction of knowledge graphs partially, hence reducing labor and optimizing scalability."

The technique bridges data representation-user intent and facilitates efﬁcient metadata management. 2.3 Previous Studies’ Strengths and Weaknesses The integration of ML and semantic web technologies is two-pronged. The automated building of knowledge graphs reduces labor and promotes scalability, as observed through semi-automatic practices in recent literature [ 1, 3]. Moreover, the accurate gener- ation of SPARQL queries through ML promotes efﬁcient data retrieval, yielding quality metadata [ 2]. Ensemble learning strategies such as random forest, while deployed for predicting data fetch status in RDF data, improve data processing efﬁciency [ 3]. However, these strategies have their limitations. The application of available tools for the semi-automatic generation of knowledge graphs might lack ﬂexibility [1, 2].

It might be challenging and time-consuming [ 3–7]. 2.4 Critical Analysis of Existing Gaps Despite considerable advancement, various shortcomings need to be met. Scalability in systems using ontology is complex, and editing and maintaining large-scale systems such as DBpedia is labor-intensive, hence becoming an inhibitor to scalability. Today’s more signiﬁcant part of systems is structured data-centric, with no efﬁcient incorporation and management of unstructured data sources. Real-time data categorization and processing is cumbersome in light of ongoing data inﬂows. Moreover, applying large annotated datasets for training ML models limits their use in scenarios where such data do not prevail. The challenge of maintaining current- ness in rapidly evolving application areas intensiﬁes such limitations. Such limitations must be overcome to produce robust and general-purpose systems for automatic data categorization and metadata maintenance. 2.5 Positioning of the Current Study This research attempts to address the mentioned shortcomings by proposing machine learning-oriented architecture on the DBpedia Ontology Dataset for automatic data cat- egorization and organization of metadata.

Moreover, the system is designed to be domain-agnostic, addressing the domain adaptability challenge.

While accurate, both fall short of being computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for real-time usage or usage within limited-resource environments.

The system utilizes a hybrid ML architecture, using standard classiﬁcation models and deep learning entity recognition to ensure scalability and generalizability to various domains [ 8]. The model processes data in three primary steps. The ﬁrst is to preprocess raw data, such as treating missing values, splitting text data, and extracting prominent features.

The data is processed by text normalization, stopword elimination, and entity recognition to prepare for classiﬁcation.

The dataset is then trained using supervised machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support V ector Machines (SVM), and transformer-based deep learning for entity classiﬁcation. The models are ﬁne-tuned using cross-validation strategies to improve accuracy and prevent overﬁtting [ 9, 10]. After training, the model is deployed in a live classiﬁcation context, annotating metadata for new data ﬂows.

The model in Fig. 1 uses a pipeline architecture, where every module communicates with the next to provide a linear classiﬁcation process. Machine learning and NLP make efﬁcient text-based metadata categorization possible, while structured data storage and retrieval are made possible using a knowledge graph [ 11, 12].

Thus, the model can potentially be biased toward cer- tain representations of data and not others, which could be detrimental, particularly to undercovered regions. It could produce biased metadata classiﬁcation and unfair results, particularly for systems like content recommendation or semantic search. These issues can be tackled by future research into how to identify and mitigate bias within training data and model prediction. Some methods that can be employed to make the model more robust and fairer include data augmentation, adversarial training, and fairness-aware training. 5.2 Scalability Issues Another weakness of the suggested system is its scalability in handling large datasets of inputs in actual setups. As much as our model recorded an impressive 40% reduction of time to process, it is still computationally expensive, with heavy usage of GPUs to perform deep learning processes. The hybrid system, which combines ontological methods and deep learning models based on BERT, can be stretched to its limits in actual setups requiring processing large quantities of data at scale. For instance, with increasing dataset sizes, model efﬁciency can be compromised, and real-time classiﬁcation may not be achieved unless optimized further with extra steps.

Running this model on a platform hosted in the cloud, such as AWS SageMaker, reduces these issues to a certain extent, but that may introduce extra cost and maintenance concerns. Further research must target model compression, distributed computation, and edge computing solution ﬁelds to promote scalability and reduce reliance on high-end hardware. 5.3 Ethical Concerns Several ethical concerns are involved with machine learning metadata management, primarily in data privacy and model interpretability. 446 T. K. Kota  Data Privacy: The system can be applied to sensitive data containing personal or conﬁdential data. It should be ensured that the system complies with data privacy legislations like GDPR and CCPA, which mandate that the privacy rights of data subjects not be infringed upon. Anonymization and secure data storage must be employed to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive metadata.  Model Transparency and Explainability: While BERT models have achieved state- of-the-art performance for most natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they are mostly considered exceptionally uninterpretable. It is preferable to ensure that model- generated prediction is interpretable for stakeholders in high-stakes decision-making domains, such as medicine or ﬁnance. Explainability AI (XAI) techniques must be incorporated to instill trust and accountability into the system.  Accountability: Within automated metadata tagging systems, there must be estab- lished channels of accountability.

The proposed approach of integrating DBpedia’s structured knowledge with ML-based classiﬁcation achieved 92.4% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.93, a 24% improvement over traditional meth- ods. The processing efﬁciency also increased, reducing classiﬁcation time by 40% and enabling real-time metadata tagging and retrieval. These ﬁndings conﬁrm the value of integrating structured knowledge graphs with NLP-based classiﬁcation methods to facilitate large-scale and automated metadata management. The practical applications of the research extend to large-scale information retrieval systems, digital libraries, content recommendation engines, and enterprise data man- agement. By automating metadata tagging and achieving consistency in classiﬁcation, the approach reduces manual effort and enhances knowledge discovery.

The outputs also verify machine learning’s potential for data processing in semantics, conﬁrming AI-driven models of data classiﬁcation [ 11]. Despite these successes, there have also been constraints. The model’s success is based on quality tagged data, which is not always available for domains. Furthermore, while BERT models have better accuracy, their computational demands are higher, and therefore, in resource-constrained environments, they might not be optimal. The chal- lenge is solving inconsistencies in metadata and ontologies, which must adapt to provide accurate classiﬁcations. If overcome, these constraints would ensure that AI-powered metadata management systems are scalable and ﬂexible [ 10]. Future research areas include reducing the amount of annotated data using unsu- pervised models and self-learning models. Research on low-complexity machine learn- ing models capable of delivering comparable accuracy but lower computational cost would advance models’ application in multiple scenarios [ 9].

While it remains the leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women in the United States, it is also one of the most preventable forms of cancer by refraining from smoking and avoiding exposure to second-hand smoke. There are over 20 types of lung cancer. There are two primary types: non- small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer. It is responsible for the majority of cancer-related deaths among men and women. There are more than 20 different varieties of lung cancer, but the two most common are non-small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer.

American Cancer Society predicted that around 238,340 new instances of lung cancer will be diagnosed in 2023, with approximately 127,070 deaths as a result. [ 2]. Detecting lung cancer early is crucial to reducing mortality rates, but it is a challenging goal. Unfortunately, over 80% of patients are diagnosed at the middle or advanced stages of the disease, making them ineligible for surgery. As a result, the 5-year survival rate is only 14%, whereas it could be more than 70% if lung cancer were diagnosed earlier [ 3]. X-ray chest radiography is currently the only cost-effective screening method for lung cancer, despite controversial opinions on its usefulness. It also offers the advantage of lower radiation exposure compared to more sensitive methods like CT. Besides detecting lung nodules, chest screening can also identify other illnesses like pneumonia, emphysema, COPD, heart failure, and other heart problems. However, interpreting chest X-ray images can be challenging even for experienced pulmonologists and radiologists [ 4]."

CAD provides a computer-generated output as an additional assessment to help physicians identify abnormalities, track disease progression, and differentiate between different types of lesions. Physicians rely on visual examination of images, which can be monotonous and error-prone. CAD systems enable lesion detection and characterization by reducing the time required for an appropriate diagnosis and boosting physicians’ abilities in difﬁcult instances due to complicated anatomy, various types of benign and cancerous states, and variances in physicians’ capabilities [ 5]. 2 Related Work Over the years, various CAD systems have been created and assessed in the ﬁeld of research aimed at detecting and locating lung nodules. These CAD systems have been enhanced with the advancement of techniques and computing power. Wu and Zhao [6] proposed a supervised machine learning technique for diagnosing small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) from chest CT scans. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 77.8%. Rahane et al.

Five groups of lung nodule photographs were classiﬁed according to the degree of subtlety [ 16]. b) Enhancement Since the contrast of the original images is low, any additional processing on them will produce undesirable results; the contrast must be increased. Because it will improve the image’s quality and contrast. We employ histogram equalization and high-frequency emphasis ﬁltering (HFEF). An HFEF, a technique for sharpening images, is the ﬁrst step. In the frequency domain, the differentiation of an image is mistakenly understood like ﬁltering that focuses on higher frequency components. Any linear operator in the spatial domain can be translated into a corresponding transfer function in the frequency domain, so a transfer function that emphasizes high-frequency regions can implement a linear operator that emphasizes abrupt changes in intensity. The second step, histogram equalization, is a technique for modifying image intensities to improve contrast. Fig. 3 displays the image both before and after enhancement [ 3]. Fig. 2.

All of the relevant information in the X- ray image was supplied to the diagnostic system, allowing it easily distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue. In this study, a total of 549 features is used to the ROI. The extracted features are classiﬁed into six main groups: ﬁrst-order statistics, second-order statistics (grey level co-occurrence matrix), shape features, fractal dimension features, and wavelet features. E.1 First Order Statistics Features: The extraction of ﬁrst-order statistical features involves retrieving image features by analyzing the characteristics of the image histogram, without taking into account the relationship between neighboring pixels. The features obtained through this method are calculated from the texture images, using statistical measures such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis [ 17]. 26 features, which represented ﬁrst-order textural features, are derived from ROI. Second Order Statistics Features: The grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features are the most prevalent kind of second-order statistics features.

In the chosen ROI subregion, the GLCM describes the spatial distribution of grey levels. An element at the GLCM’s location (i,j) denotes the joint probability the density of occurrence of the gray levels i and j in the given orientation and at the given distance d from one another. As a result, different GLCMs are produced for various values of d. For each chosen ROI subregion, four GLCMs were determined: one distance (d = 1 p i x e l ) , four directions (0°, 45°, 90°, and 135), and four angles (0°, 45°, 90°, and 135) [ 18]. 23 features were derived from each GLCM, and Four values were acquired per each feature, according to the four matrices. Several GLCM parameters were investigated, including energy, contrast, correlation, homogeneity, etc. [19]. These attributes quantify second-order texture properties as follows: For an image with N pixels, i and j signify pixel coordinates, and p(i,j) denotes the normalized probability of two intensity values co-occurring at a particular spatial offset in GLCM texture analysis.

The Daubechies-4 (db4) wavelet is a perfect choice because it offers an excellent trade-off between compact support (localized feature extraction) and smoothness (noise reduction) [ 22]. Three levels of decomposition are to be carried out: Level 1 for ﬁne nodule edges, Level 2 for texture variations, and Level 3 for over- all shape. At the end of the decomposition process, this representation can efﬁciently describe malignant nodule points (irregular edges, heterogeneous textures) while reduc- ing artifacts.

Therefore, this operation causes each vector coefﬁcient to never exceed one in value. Therefore, normalization is utilized to simplify the coefﬁcients. [ 23]. Energy Computation: The energy of each vector was calculated by squaring each element in the vector. The obtained values are used as features in the classiﬁcation stage. Features Reduction: The wavelet decomposition produces a large number of coefﬁcients or features. As a result, in the ﬁnal phase, the number of features is limited by calculating the mean column for each wavelet coefﬁcient matrix at each scale, resulting in a total of 400 wavelet features. f) Feature Selection Feature selection involves selecting a relevant group of features from a larger set of potential features. This process typically involves using evaluation criteria to determine the optimal subset of features.

Then, techniques for selecting features were used for selecting the most signiﬁcant features from the matrix. Before beginning the classiﬁcation process, it is critical for selecting the features. The success of a classiﬁcation stage is heavily dependent on the features used. In this work, StepwiseFit and Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) methods were used.

Cases were learned by using known normal and abnormal images [3]. h) Data Partitioning and Validation Strategy The dataset of 462 regions of interest (ROIs) included 308 normal, 100 malignant, and 53 benign areas, and was divided into training and testing groups using a 70:30 method. This resulted in 323 training ROIs (216 normal, 70 malignant, 37 benign) and 139 testing ROIs (92 normal, 30 malignant, 16 benign). In this case, 323 training ROIs (216 normal, 70 malignant, 37 benign), while the testing set contained 139 ROIs (92 normal, 30 malignant, 16 benign). In this way, to further validate robustness, additional 5-fold cross-validation on the training set so that each fold remained consistent with the original class ratios. Evaluation of the model performance was based on hold-out testing and cross-validation metrics. 4 Mathematical Approach The proposed CAD system was evaluated quantitatively using standard statistical measures derived from a confusion matrix.

Let: TP= True Positives (abnormal or malignant cases that have been rightfully detected). TN = True Negatives (normal or benign cases that have been correctly identiﬁed). FP = False Positives (normal or benign cases that are incorrectly labeled as abnormal or malignant). FN = False Negatives (abnormal or malignant cases that are mistakenly classiﬁed as normal or benign). The following metrics were computed: Sensitivity (Recall/True Positive Rate): Measures the system’s ability to correctly identify positive cases (abnor- mal/malignant), see Eq. ( 7). Sensitivity = TP TP + FN × 100% (7) Speciﬁcity (True Negative Rate): Measures the system’s ability to correctly identify negative cases (normal/benign), see Eq. (8). Speciﬁcity = TN TN + FP × 100% (8) 458 T. A. Alsaqqaf et al. Accuracy: Represents the overall correctness of the classiﬁer, see Eq. ( 9): Accuracy = TP + TN TP + TN + FP + FN × 100% (9) To obtain a fuller assessment of CAD system performance, 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) were calculated for all performance parameters reported by the Wilson score interval method, see Eq. ( 10). This method is especially useful when the proportions are near to 0 or 1 and the sample sizes are limited [ 27].

For sensitivity, n is the number of abnormal/malignant cases; for speciﬁcity, n is the number of normal/benign cases; and for accuracy, n is the total num- ber of cases in the test set. The intervals give a probability of 95% for the real metric value to fall within the given range, thus accounting for the uncertainty induced by limited sampling [28–31]. 5 Result and Discussion The ﬁnal results of this study are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. It was observed that the best result was the SVM classiﬁer for detecting abnormal regions and the LDA classiﬁer to classify between malignant and benign. The features after using the stepwise ﬁt feature selection method were 4 features (spreadness, homogeneity, and 2 wavelet features) to distinguish among normal and abnormal ROIs. The features after using the SFS feature selection method were 39 features (spreadness, energy, and 37 wavelet features) to differentiate between malignant and benign ROIs. Table 1.

The widths of these intervals reﬂect the uncertainty due to an insufﬁcient number of samples, especially of abnormal cases.

This may become beneﬁcial in resource-poor settings where state-of-the-art imaging facilities may not be available. Low-cost chest x-rays, an easily available and less-radiating alternative to CT scans, can be used to implement a widespread screening program for early-stage diagnosis when treatment can be optimally rendered. Detection of lung cancer is vital as the inclusion in the survival statistic is increased by early diagnosis. Enhanced feature selection also reduces computational complexity without compromising accuracy, rendering the system ﬁt and deployable for clinical conditions of low infrastructure. As a competent second-opinion system, CAD can prevent human errors in the radiological interpretation of cases in which small nodules could easily be missed. These developments could positively inﬂuence global lung cancer screening programs, cut down mortality rates, and improve the ever-important onset of diagnosis and treatment. The CAD system accuracy given in Table 3 has been compared to various similar studies indicated in the literature review section. The SVM-LDA framework achieves a ﬂawless result (100% accuracy) on the JSRT dataset, better than the performance yielded by all the methods proposed in earlier research on JSRT ([ 10] and [15] and also comparable or superior on other modalities.

Radiologists can upload their images and, within seconds, view enhanced images with segmentation or accept the computer interpretation upon abnormality classiﬁcation (normal/abnormal, malignant/benign). Hence, to some extent, this is a second opinion so that suspicious cases are preferentially reviewed and prompt decreased reading time. Consequently, considering radiographic imaging as a less costly and less radiation-technique relative to CT are facts aiding the presence of this system for ﬁrst screening, especially in resource-limited settings, while maintaining high accuracy with reported detection rates of 100% for abnormal regions and 94.1% for malignancy classiﬁcation. The CAD system under discussion is promising, but certain limitations must be acknowledged. First, the manual segmentation of lung regions might introduce subjec- tivity and greatly limit scalability for clinical applications on a larger scale. The second limitation is that the study enrolled a few subjects (247 X-ray images) from the JSRT database and therefore might not capture the diversity of presentations seen in the lung cancer patients among different populations.

The stepwise ﬁt method was used, which produced 4 features to differentiate between normal and abnormal ROIs, and the SFS method was used, which produced 39 features to differentiate between malignant and benign ROIs. Finally, SVM and LDA classiﬁers were used to detect the lung cancer and specify its type. The medical applicability of CAD systems is enhanced through studies directed at future ﬁndings that will relate to constructing automated segmentation methods to sup- plant manual processes along with expanding the dataset to accommodate more diverse cases. The introduction of deep learning techniques would probably enhance nodule detection sensitivity, especially for early-stage cancers. Real-world clinical validation should be undertaken to ascertain the performance of the system in routine diagno- sis workﬂow. Future directions have to pursue further investigation into multimodal approaches that combine X-rays with other imaging modalities. These developments would strengthen the reliability of the systems and serve as a claim to their adoption in a healthcare environment. Disclosure of Interests.

Patients with severe traumatic injuries have mortality rates that range widely, from 7% to 45%. This discrepancy is probably caused by variations in the standard of trauma care along with the diversity of patient populations in various nations and medical facilities [ 1]. Every year, many trauma specialists and frontline medical staff are tasked with making crucial triage decisions to determine which patients should receive immediate attention to manage to minimize the risk of severe complications and mortality [ 2]. To predict critical outcomes such as mortality and the need for intensive care in patients with multiple traumatic injuries numerous predictive tools—such as the Injury Severity Score (ISS), New ISS (NISS), Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), and ICD-based Injury Severity Score (ICISS)—have been developed. Despite ongoing efforts, the predictive performance of these scoring systems remains inconsistent across studies [ 3, 4]."

Unlike traditional methods, machine learning algorithms can effectively manage large, unstructured, nonlinear, or incomplete datasets, making them well-suited for predicting outcomes in this challenging patient population [ 2, 3, 5]. Conventional scoring systems were established and validated at speciﬁc points in time, predictive performance can deteriorate over time due to temporal and social changes, including an extension of life expectancy, improvements in the public health environment, and the emergence of new diseases [ 6, 7]. In order to develop a robust decision support system, this research compares the performance of various ML algorithms including Decision Tree, Artiﬁcial Neural Net- work, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Deep Learning models against how the trauma threat ends, recovery, o r exitus. Additionally, along with patient medical records, APACHE II score is also incorporated into ML algorithm. This approach has been improved predicting the prognosis of critically ill patients and by ensuring effective patient triage will contribute to reducing mortality rates while also aiding in lowering healthcare e xpenditures."

A total of 75 patients were treated in the ICU at Eskisehir Osmangazi University Health, Practice, and Research Hospital. Patient data were collected after assigning each patient a code, thereby anonymizing the information. 2.2 Preprocessing To ensure data integrity and facilitate numerical processing, an initial cleaning step was performed. This involved iterating through columns with an object data type, replacing unwanted characters to standardize decimal and categorical representations, and numer- ical columns were retained in their original format. To apply appropriate preprocessing steps, the feature columns were categorized into numerical and categorical types based on their type. The target variable, representing the clinical outcome, was derived from the intensive care unit discharge form column and encoded as a binary label: recovery and exitus."

Addressing the presence of missing values (especially, if any for future samples), a k- Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) imputer, with k = 3, was employed to impute missing values within the numerical features. Following the imputation step, the numerical features were normalized using the Min-Max scaler. This transformation scales the numerical features to a range between 0 and 1, which can be beneﬁcial for algorithms sensitive to the magnitude of input features. For the categorical features, one-hot encoding was applied. 2.3 Feature Analysis To identify the most informative features for predicting the target variable, a feature analysis process was implemented, incorporating both Information Gain (IG) and Gain Ratio (GR). These methods assess the relevance of each feature to the target variable (clinical outcome: exitus or recovery). The results of these analyses are presented in Table 1. Feature importance ranking by Information Gain and Gain Ratio (Table 2). The table reveals several important insights into the relevance of different features for predicting patient outcome.

GR corrects for the bias of IG towards features with many values.  Low Importance Features: Several features—such as maxillofacial trauma, extrem- ity trauma, chest trauma, total system trauma, ICU length of stay, and WBC (initial white blood cell count)—have no information gain (IG). This indicates that these features, individually, do not provide any discriminatory information for predicting the outcome. However, some of these features (e.g., age, gender , WBC) show some importance according to gain ratio (GR), suggesting they might contribute when combined with other features. The majority of the patients are young and fall within similar age ranges; hence, the age and gender features had similar values in this dataset. Therefore, these two features did not provide discriminatory information for this speciﬁc dataset.  Trauma Types: It’s interesting to note the varying importance of different trauma types. Abdominal trauma has a relatively low importance, while brain trauma is ranked higher. This suggests that the location and severity of trauma play a differential role in predicting outcome.  Clinical Implications: The feature analysis provides valuable insights for clinicians and model developers.

The low-importance features might be considered for exclusion from the model to reduce complexity and potentially improve generalization. A notable observation from the whole feature analysis is that while IG highlights a subset of dominant features, GR suggests a more distributed contribution across the feature set. Speciﬁcally, several features that exhibit zero IG demonstrate non-zero GR values. This discrepancy can be attributed to GR’s ability to mitigate the bias of IG towards features with numerous distinct values. GR normalizes IG by the intrinsic infor- mation of each feature, thus revealing the predictive power of features that might be overshadowed by high-cardinality variables in IG analysis. The fact that GR assigns some level of importance to almost all features, even those with zero IG, presents a challenge for aggressive feature reduction. Discarding fea- tures solely based on IG might lead to an information loss, potentially compromising the model’s ability to capture subtle but relevant patterns in the data. This is particularly crucial in medical datasets, where seemingly minor variables might hold valuable contex- tual information that contributes to a more nuanced understanding of patient outcomes. Therefore, given the potential for information loss and the comprehensive perspective offered by GR, a conservative approach was adopted in this study.

Accuracy metric measures the overall correctness of the model’s predictions, calcu- lated as the proportion of correctly predicted cases (TP + TN) out of the total number of cases. Precision, speciﬁcally for recovery prediction, indicates the proportion of cases predicted as recovery that were indeed recovery cases (TP / (TP + FP)). It reﬂects the model’s ability to avoid falsely predicting a fatal outcome when the patient recovers. Recall (or sensitivity), also for recovery prediction, measures the proportion of actual recovery cases that were correctly predicted by the model (TP / (TP + FN)). It repre- sents the model’s ability to identify all patients who will recover. The F1-score provides a balanced measure of precision and recall, calculated as the harmonic mean of the two (2*TP/(2*TP +FP + FN) or 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)). The F1-score is particularly useful when there is an imbalance between the number of recovery and exitus cases. 2.5 Machine Learning Models and Hyperparameter Selection To predict the in-hospital mortality of trauma patients, several machine learning classiﬁ- cation algorithms were employed.

The selection of these algorithms encompasses a range of model complexities and inductive biases, allowing for a comparative assessment of their predictive capabilities on the study data. For each machine learning algorithm, except the DL model, a pipeline was con- structed. To optimize the hyperparameters of each model, a grid search approach was implemented. This involved deﬁning a parameter grid speciﬁc to each classiﬁer, outlining the range of hyper parameter values to be explored. A stratiﬁed 5-fold cross-validation was used during the grid search to ensure robust parameter tuning, particularly given the potential for class imbalance. The scoring metric used for hyper parameter optimization was the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. The best performing model and its corresponding hyper parameters, as determined by the grid search, were then proceeded to the prediction experiments. The DL model, implemented using Tensor Flow/Keras, consisted of a simple sequen- tial architecture with a dense layer of 10 neurons and ReLU activation, followed by an output dense layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classiﬁcation.

The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss function, and F1-score as the evaluation metric. It was trained for 50 epochs. A leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) strategy was employed to obtain a robust estimate of the generalization performance of each best-tuned model for a dataset with a small number of samples. This method involves iteratively training the model on all but one sample and testing on the held-out sample. Given the limited sample size in the dataset, to ensure the robustness and generaliz- ability of the machine learning model evaluations, we conducted the training and testing procedures over 150 multiple independent test runs, each with a different random seed (still, same environmental settings for comparative purposes). Single evaluations can be susceptible to random variations in the train-test split, particularly with datasets of lim- ited size. This multiple approach mitigates the potential for biased performance estimates arising from a speciﬁc data partitioning, and the reported results represent the average performance metrics across these multiple runs.

We observe variations in both the median number of TPs and the interquartile range (IQR), indicating differences in the sta- bility of recovery prediction across the multiple runs. For instance, a model with a tighter IQR suggests more consistent performance in correctly predicting recovery, irrespective of the random seed used for data partitioning.

Differences in the median and IQR across the models highlight varying degrees of stability in identifying true negative cases. A narrower IQR for a given model suggests a more robust ability to correctly predict mortality across different data splits. Outliers in the TN distributions point to speciﬁc iterations where the model’s performance in correctly identifying exitus cases was notably higher or lower than its typical performance. By examining the distributions of TP and TN, we can gain a more nuanced under- standing of each model’s strengths and weaknesses in correctly classifying both out- comes (recovery and exitus) and the consistency of these predictions across different random partitions of the limited dataset.

Notably, many of these scores heavily depend on clinical judgment, especially when it comes to injury cod- ing, anatomical region assignment, or initial physiological evaluations. The evaluation process becomes more subjective and variable as a result. However, a different strategy that relies less on subjective interpretation is provided by machine learning (ML) algorithms. ML models can identify intricate, non-linear relationships that are frequently overlooked by traditional scoring methods by analyz- ing vast amounts of varied clinical data, including vital signs, laboratory results, time- series trends, and comorbidity proﬁles. ML techniques dynamically adjust their internal parameters based on patterns found in the data itself, producing more personalized and objective predictions than traditional scores that treat each variable independently or in limited interaction. 4 Conclusions In this study, we demonstrated the ability of various ML algorithms to predict in-hospital mortality of ICU in patients and proposed a robust method to be used as decision support system.

The simulations were conducted using custom-built models in Python and MA TLAB, relying on theoretical models including Shannon’s capacity theorem, the inverse square law for radiation, and free-space path loss models. The following metrics were analyzed: • Network Capacity (bps vs distance): Based on signal degradation over distance using exponential decay models. • Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR): Measured as a function of user position to evaluate interference mitigation. • Latency: Evaluated across user load from 0 to 1000 users. • Coverage Radius: Calculated using free-space path loss and signal threshold formulas. • Transmission Speed: Derived using Shannon’s capacity Eq.

Key observations from the curve include: • X-axis: Distance from the base station (in meters), ranging from 0 to 1000 m. • Y -axis: Network capacity (bps), plotted on a logarithmic or large exponential scale (e.g., 1e + 11). From the curve, we observe the following: • The red curve (5G) exhibits lower overall capacity compared to 6G, with a gradual decline as distance increases. • The blue curve (6G) starts signiﬁcantly higher than 5G, indicating a much greater initial capacity. While it also declines with distance, it does so at a slower rate, maintaining superior performance over longer ranges. Fig. 2. Network capacity evolution 5G vs 6G.

AI-Driven Evolution: Bridging 5G and 6G 483 This interpretation demonstrates that 6G offers signiﬁcantly higher capacity than 5G, particularly at shorter ranges. This advantage is likely due to the use of advanced spectrum (e.g., terahertz bands) and AI-enhanced optimization techniques. Although capacity decreases with distance for both technologies due to path loss and signal attenuation, 6G sustains higher capacity over longer distances, indicating improved coverage efﬁciency and spectral utilization. These ﬁndings align with theoretical projections. 6G is expected to deliver up to 100 times higher capacity than 5G, supporting ultra-high data rates, massive IoT deployments, and real-time applications. The observed degradation in capacity is con- sistent with Shannon’s capacity theorem, which states that capacity decreases as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) diminishes with increasing distance. 4.2 Interference Management Simulation: 5G vs 6G Curve analysis for interference management in 5G vs. 6G is presented in Fig. 3.

This suggests that, in this representation, there is no measurable power density for either 5G or 6G within the given scale. • This could imply one of the following: o The power densities are extremely low (below the resolution of the graph). o The data is placeholder or incomplete (e.g., awaiting actual measurements). o The scale on the y-axis is inappropriate for the expected values (e.g., if power densities are typically in µW/m2 or nW/m2).

Rongali 2 Literature Review 2.1 Comprehensive Survey Healthcare information integration has arrived with standardized formats such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) to facilitate seamless information exchange between disparate healthcare systems. Although such technologies are avail- able, the most serious challenge is to follow strict regulatory frameworks. Mulesoft and similar platforms have provided interoperability by facilitating seamless informa- tion exchange between electronic health record (EHR) systems, insurance organizations, and third-party applications. However, monitoring compliance for such integrations is almost entirely dependent on rule-based systems, which are generally poor at meeting new regulatory requirements [ 2, 3]. In large healthcare networks, the manual effort to scan for compliance breaches in exchanging information is so massive that such breaches become more probable to go unnoticed.

Most healthcare compliance monitoring efforts have focused on traditional auditing mechanisms that ﬂag policy violations against predeﬁned security rules. Hospitals that use EHRs, for example, use static rule sets to catch attempted accesses by unauthorized individuals. While this method successfully detects known compliance vulnerabilities, it does not catch emerging dangers in dynamic healthcare environments. AI-based methods have, therefore, been sought to ﬁll this gap, with machine learning models being found to be effective in detecting anomalies in patient data transactions. There have been experiments demonstrating the potential for AI to predict security breaches in hospital networks [ 4, 5]. Still, such models have rarely seen deployment in real-time compliance monitoring processes. Another crucial aspect of compliance monitoring is the availability of realistic datasets to train AI models. Researchers use synthetic sources since accurate patient records are highly sensitive and governed by strict privacy laws. Synthea, the most widely used framework for generating realistic but entirely synthetic FHIR data, played an imperative role in simulating healthcare interoperability scenarios. This set enables researchers to test AI models for compliance monitoring without compromising accurate patient information [ 6, 7]. While it is helpful, even synthetic data faces challenges in sim- ulating the full complexity of real-world clinical workﬂows, limiting the generalizability of AI-based compliance solutions."

Most security and compliance monitoring AI models are currently available as stand-alone tools and are not incorporated into real- time data exchange processes. Isolation reduces their real-world utility, as compliance monitoring needs to be an integral part of the data integration pipeline and not an after- the-fact auditing feature. Most prior studies have only considered AI for cybersecurity in the healthcare scenario but have yet to investigate its use for regulatory compliance for interoperability frameworks [ 9]. AI-Enhanced Compliance Monitoring in Healthcare Data Integration 495 One signiﬁcant shortcoming of existing compliance monitoring systems is that they rely on retrospective review, not proactive detection. In most hospital networks, for example, security teams go through the logs of accesses and audits to ﬁnd compliance breaches only after they have occurred. In contrast, an AI solution can alert in real-time when patterns in the exchange of information indicate possible violations.

However, the challenge is training AI models to differentiate between valid and non-compliant transactions because healthcare information is complex and context-speciﬁc [ 10]. Despite the growing use of synthetic data for training AI models, existing work has yet to explore its potential for use cases related to compliance monitoring in depth. While Synthea can generate realistic patient records, it is beyond its capabilities to simulate policy violations and security attacks. AI models trained on such datasets can fail when applied to real-world use cases, with compliance violations often involving intricate human activities such as an employee’s unauthorized access or incorrect information sharing across organizations. Filling these gaps requires extending synthetic datasets to incorporate the complexities of real-world compliance violations and integrating AI- based compliance monitoring into healthcare data integration platforms [ 11]. 2.3 Relevance to Current Study The literature review establishes the need for an augmented compliance monitoring framework that directly integrates AI-based anomaly detection into healthcare data exchange platforms.

Besides, whereas AI has shown promise in healthcare security, its application in real-time monitoring for compliance in integration platforms remains to be thoroughly examined. This work addresses the gap by incorporating AI-based veriﬁcation for com- pliance into Mulesoft processes to enable real-time anomaly detection during transac- tions.

But with AI inte- gration, the system offers various avenues through which it can evolve to accommodate new compliance requirements after training:  Ongoing Learning and Model Retraining: AI models are re-trained against new data at frequencies determined by updates to compliance rules, new risks, and changing healthcare compliance regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.

As and when new patterns of non-compliance or dubious data-sharing patterns are identiﬁed, there is instant feedback to the system, and models for monitoring can be re-calibrated accordingly. Feedback is available to guide continuously and allows for constantly adapting to changing compliance situations. Thus, violations are being caught and remediated as and when they happen.  Hybrid AI Models for Added Flexibility: Hybrid AI models, a combination of rule- based and machine-learning models, represent a future component that can be added to the system.

In this system, regulatory guidelines such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) have been codiﬁed, as a result of which compliance checking could be done automatically in real-time.

These include data privacy regulations, access control require- ments, data sharing policies, and consent management protocols. For instance, HIPAA requires the protection of sensitive patient data, i.e., secure sharing and restricted access, while GDPR requires stringent data consent, storage, and transmission processes, especially across borders.  Machine-Readable Representation: Once compliance rules were deﬁned, they were represented as machine-readable representations. It declared policies as conditions, data structures, and expected behavior for data process ﬂows. For example, access control policies under HIPAA were declared as conditions specifying transactions where unauthorized personnel attempted to read sensitive health data. Policies for data consent under GDPR were declared as checking to establish sufﬁcient records and validation of patient consent for the process of data during exchanges.  Policy V alidation Module Incorporation: The encoded compliance rules were subse- quently incorporated into the Policy V alidation Module, which is used as a runtime model validation tool. The Policy V alidation Module compares anomalies AI mod- els detect (i.e., Random Forest, Autoencoder) with encoded policies.

In that case, the Policy V alidation Module will cross-check with the GDPR consent policy. It raises an alarm for investigation if a violation is found. Similarly, whenever a healthcare professional tries to access a patient’s private data outside of the role-based access control deﬁned, it is matched with the HIPAA access control policies and noted as a potential violation if non-compliance is identiﬁed.  Dynamic Policy Updates: The compliance regulations encoded into the system can be dynamically updated to adapt the system to evolving regulatory demands. For instance, all new updates to HIPAA or GDPR are interpreted into the validation module as and when received. This adaptability creates the scope to make regulatory updates available for inclusion by the AI-driven compliance monitoring system at zero human intervention. 500 S. K.

Application of machine-readable, encoded compliance rules and incorporation of the rules within model validation is essential to enable the AI system to efﬁciently and timely detect compliance breaches and reduce manual effort for audit. 3.6 Handling False Positives in Real-World Deployment Among the biggest hurdles to implementing AI-driven compliance monitoring systems in healthcare settings is addressing false positives—instances where the system incorrectly identiﬁes legitimate activity as compliance offenses. False positives lead to unneces- sary warnings, review procedures, and diminished trust in the system, which will harm the operational effectiveness of healthcare workers. Therefore, false positives must be addressed at the system framework design and deployment phase of the compliance monitoring system."

Therefore, false positives must be addressed at the system framework design and deployment phase of the compliance monitoring system. The model proposed here involves several aspects to regulate and eliminate false positives effectively to make the system practical and dependable for practical purposes:  Model Choice and Achievement of Performance: The selection of models is crucial for minimizing false positives. Between models tested (Random Forest, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoder), Random Forest achieved the least false positive under experimental conditions and is therefore preferred for use under live conditions. Random Forest, with an accurate rate of 95.1% and just 4.2% as a false positive, is less likely to mark good transactions as non-compliant than others. The system favors this model under live compliance checking to keep false positives at a minimum.  Rules-Based Post-Detection V alidation Policy: The Policy V alidation Module sup- ports A second validation stage, which cross-validates anomalies found with regula- tory compliance policies (i.e., HIPAA and GDPR). Where an indicated violation is potential, this module checks that an identiﬁed anomaly correlates to a compliance violation before raising an alarm.

AI-Enhanced Compliance Monitoring in Healthcare Data Integration 501 Threshold adjustment is employed within the suggested system to optimize the detec- tion of actual violations and prevent unnecessary false positives. Normal scoring can be thresholded appropriately (i.e., limiting to a maximum score that a transaction must have before being labeled as abnormal). Thus, the system will be optimized to prevent normals from being labeled randomly as non-compliant. Threshold adjust- ment is required to make the system sensitive enough to detect violations but not sensitive enough to ﬂag regular activity frequently.  Continuous Learning and Feedback: The system has a real-time feedback loop wherein security teams or compliance ofﬁcers manually verify anomalies detected. When a mistake, i.e., a false positive, is detected upon veriﬁcation, the model is refreshed with new data to learn from. Continuous learning enables the model to improve over time as it gets more and more data through real transactions.

Explainable AI (XAI) methods like attribute importance ratings or decision trees can help compliance ofﬁcers understand why a model prediction was made. With an ultra-clear understanding of why speciﬁc transactions were identiﬁed, human specialists are well-placed to make informed decisions about whether there was a violation or if ﬂagging was a false alarm. It deters reliance on system-automated choices and allows for more speciﬁc manual intervention wherever necessary.  Hybrid Model Usage: Future development can yield an added veriﬁcation tier through integration between AI models and systems of rules to protect against false alarm occurrences. Hybrid models can merge machine learning models’ ability to recognize complex patterns with accuracy and consistency provided by traditional compliance rules. For example, while recognizing abnormality during data transfer patterns, the rule system can cross-verify with deﬁned rules to ascertain if or not there is an abnor- mality. The two-stage veriﬁcation ensures that only actual violations are escalated, lowering the rate of false alarm occurrences.  Risk-Based Prioritization: Not all anomalies are created equal in live production."

Signiﬁcant risks, such as unauthorized access to sensitive patient data, are reserved for high-priority remediation. In contrast, lesser risks may be reserved for future review but not for remediation.

For one, the simulated data does not capture the richness of real-world compliance breaches such as insider attacks, intricate fraud schemes, or adversarial attacks. Secondly, the AI mod- els were trained on structured transaction logs and thus cannot process unstructured compliance-related information such as clinical notes or audit reports. Thirdly, false positives are also an issue, particularly for Autoencoder-based models, which labeled more legitimate transactions as anomalies.

The traditional perimeter security systems have not performed satisfactorily against a cloud environment’s distributed and dynamic components. The security threats in a cloud environment reinforce the need for businesses to adopt a more robust, adaptive, and intelligent security model or architecture, which has led to the exploration of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) augmented with Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) capabilities. Although Zero Trust security concepts are appealing, the practical application of security using Zero Trust models in cloud environments can be challenging to imple- ment. Traditional Zero Trust solutions leverage manual conﬁgurations, static policies, or predetermined access rules that cannot keep pace with dynamic cyber threats or shifting user behaviors. Entering either of those policies without intelligent automation can cause Zero Trust solutions to become static, ineffective, and vulnerable to advanced attacks. There is a pressing need for intelligent AI-based systems to dynamically implement Zero Trust strategies in real-time while enhancing threat intelligence, or expanding real-time access-now capabilities in cloud computing ecosystems.

In a zero-trust framework, trust is never assumed, and access to the resource is always authenticated. The zero-trust concept is “never trust, always verify.” Thus, the user and device are untrusted in the default mode, irrespective of whether they are inside the corporate network.

The performance will be measured using some critical parameters such as:  Accuracy: To ﬁnd the overall accuracy of the AI-based model in identifying legitimate and malicious attempts to access the network.  Precision and Recall: To ﬁnd the model’s ability to correctly identify true positives (wrongdoing) with the minimum number of false positives and false negatives.  False-Positive Rate: A key indicator of the performance of the AI model, both in terms of security and user satisfaction, through the reduction in unnecessary access denials. The metrics will provide an average indicator of the performance of the AI-based Zero Trust model. It will be utilized to tune and optimize the system for deployment in the cloud."

Systematic choice of parameters con- sisted of best practice in theory and practical modiﬁcations through experimentation. The selected model type, dataset characteristics, compute efﬁciency, and various per- formance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, false positive rate) guided the choice of parameters. 3.4.1 Parameter Selection for Random Forest In our Random Forest model, we tuned the two most important parameters, the number of decision trees (n_estimators) and the maximum depth of trees (max_depth). We ﬁrst 514 J. B. Butani performed a grid search through various values of n_estimators (50–500) and max_depth (5–50).

The model comparison was com- pleted using linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels. The RBF kernel outperformed other kernels in the anomaly detection task comparison. The proper C was in the range of 1 to 10, indicating a proper trade-off between margin maximizing (the classiﬁcation bound- ary) and minimizing classiﬁers’ misclassiﬁcations, while the gamma hyperparameters could be tuned between 0.001 and 0.01 to achieve optimal classiﬁcation performance while avoiding overﬁtting. 3.4.3 Parameter Selection for Neural Networks Key parameters optimized in Neural Networks were: the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons per layer, the activation function, the learning rate, and the batch size. A preliminary search of the design space included networks with 1, 2, and 3 hidden layers and 32 neurons to 256 neurons per layer. We settled on using the ReLU (Rectiﬁed Linear Unit) activation function because it is computationally efﬁcient for training deep models and is not subject to vanishing gradient issues.

Cross-validation was key to avoid the pitfalls of model overﬁtting and the need to gener- alize across different cloud use-cases. Computational efﬁciency again becomes essential, partly due to the potential utility of pursuing real-time application of either model, as the cloud environments are primarily predicated on high-speed threat mitigation and access control.

The Random Forest model performed the best overall, with accuracy levels above 90% for legitimate and malicious access attempts.

Neural Networks also performed very well and had accuracy levels similar to Random Forest, but took longer to train, and their resource requirements were even greater. The SVM model performed adequately but had a higher false-positive rate than both Random Forest and Neural Networks, and SVM also struggled with the complex behavioral nature of the cloud and performed at an acceptable level with less complicated attack types.

First, traditional zero trust models often involve static, rules-based access control policies and slow, manual threat detection, where organizations rely on human security operations teams to analyze threat behavior activity. This study’s AI-enhanced Zero Trust model utilizes machine learning algorithms based on fast time series analysis. This AI-enhanced Zero Trust model analyzes ‘big data’, allowing an organization’s response time to network anomalies and access data faster than an organization using static rules or even human-based Security Operations (SecOps) teams, where they rely on threat indicators. The response time to detect anomalies is crucial because every time a speed threat actor can establish a foothold into an organization’s cyber defenses, it is more maliciously harmful, as innovations and sophisticated threats become reﬁned and devious. Secondly, existing approaches often miss their objectives as they provide high false- positive rates, which create alert fatigue in the organization’s security team and limit operational security capability.

The proposed AI-based approaches in this study (espe- cially Random Forest and Neural Networks) produced low false-positive rates while remaining high in precision and recall, and low false-positive rates improve the security team’s bandwidth to sort the actual threats, instead of dealing with alerts of suspected threats that turn out to be benign. Thirdly, the proposed method has the advantages of scalability and automation. Unlike traditional security frameworks, which rely heavily on human beings to keep access policies and threat indicators updated, the AI-based Zero Trust model learns new behavior patterns and updates its threat detection and access control policies with- out human intervention. This allows the security system to learn and recombine while remaining resilient and relevant in large and rapidly changing cloud environments. Lastly, many traditional systems have been designed exclusively to defend against speciﬁc threat scenarios or isolated environments. In contrast, the AI-based Zero Trust model displayed learning generalization across multiple datasets and attack types, rang- ing from common intrusions to advanced persistent threats (APTs). This ability to gen- eralize learning and adapt is much more valuable and future-proof than any traditional, non-hierarchical, trend-based system in a world where massive cloud infrastructures will be complex and heterogeneous."

AI-Based Zero Trust Security Models for Cloud Computing 517 As a summary, this proposed model combines the never trust, always verify principle of Zero Trust with the predictive and adaptive capabilities of AI, and allows for greater accuracy in efﬁcient threat detection and access control, while also mitigating many tra- ditional limitations of foregoing Zero Trust frameworks (i.e. static policies and changes in threat responses; slow reaction rate to low impact threats, operational inefﬁciencies). 5 Summary and Conclusion This research investigates how Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) can be integrated into Zero Trust security models, taking security in cloud computing (and related contexts) to a new level of operational effectiveness. Using empirical research methodology, we accomplished this by investigating Random Forests, Support V ector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks within a machine learning approach, providing evidence that AI makes Zero Trust architectures exponentially better in detecting threats, better in auto- matic control for access control, and better when the underpinning framework is changed on the ﬂy for practical work in the cloud.

In terms of improving the quality of risk analysis, cross- sectional false favorable rates were reduced, as is known. Unknown cyber threats were detected, and above all, the quality of classiﬁcation and accuracy was achieved at a level of comfort that exceeds the traditional use of security heuristics. In summary, the ﬁnd- ings suggest that introducing AI into the Zero Trust framework may represent the further realization of the slogan “never trust and always verify” a great deal more effectively than the conventional static model-based Zero Trust framework. Incorporating AI into Zero Trust architectures marks a considerable evolution of cloud security plans. The use of AI in Zero Trust models allows organizations to auto- mate security monitoring, ensure the real-time identiﬁcation of advanced threats, and gain the ability to dynamically adjust access control decisions based on continual anal- ysis of user behavior. This improves security resilience and reduces dependence on manual management of security policies, thus making securing sprawling, distributed cloud environments more possible. As organizations increasingly pursue multi-cloud and hybrid migrations, formulating AI-enabled Zero Trust models will be extremely important for sustaining security, operational efﬁciencies, and regulatory compliance in a technology, risk, and compliance landscape that has the potential to change frequently."

For self-driving cars, real-time decision-making is crucial.

This is implemented with multi-core CPU and GPU archi- tectures. In a simulated environment, our parallel approach for object detection combines the advantages of handling multiple sensor data with concurrent devel- opment based on convolutional neural networks.

One of the most critical components of self-driving technology is its real- time decision-making process and capability. A V must continuously analyse sensor data, including camera images, LiDAR information, which is a remote sensing technology that uses laser beams to measure distances between objects and create precise 3D models of space, and radar signals, to make split-second decisions regarding vehicle control, routing, and obstacle avoidance [ 7–12]. Such decisions must be executed quickly and accurately to ensure the safety and reliability of vehicles operating in dynamic environ- ments.

By using them, the newcomer guarantees a more predictable performance because tasks are processed linearly. This leads to the development process becoming much simpler because there is no need for complex synchronization mechanisms. 2.2 Disadvantages of Sequential Algorithms Each step must wait for the previous one to ﬁnish, which introduces delays in time- sensitive applications like real-time decision-making in A Vs.

By distributing tasks across multiple processors or cores, parallel systems can perform computations much faster, which means better response time for real-time decisions.

Maintaining low latency is vital in autonomous vehicle systems, as it enables instantaneous decision-making. Sequential algorithms face inherent limitations, particularly when dealing with dynamic workloads, which can exac- erbate latency issues. In contrast, parallel processing signiﬁcantly reduces wait times for operations by distributing tasks across multiple processors, if available. For instance, in the sensor fusion system of an autonomous vehicle, parallel processing can simulta- neously manage data from multiple sensors and pipelines. In comparison, a sequential program would process one data stream at a time, leading to delays. This ability to make near-instantaneous decisions is essential for navigating obstacles and adapting to sudden changes in road conditions.

Furthermore, distributing the computational load across multiple processors enhances Parallel Processing for Real-Time Decision-Making in Self-driving Cars 523 resource efﬁciency, allowing parallel systems to capitalize on all available computing resources. This efﬁciency necessitates effective load balancing—the process of evenly distributing tasks among different processors. Poor load balancing can lead to some processors being overloaded while others remain idle, ultimately diminishing overall system performance. In autonomous systems, where resource-intensive tasks like sen- sor fusion, object recognition, and decision-making occur, effective load balancing is critical. If one processor is burdened with too many tasks while others are underutilized, system performance can degrade, increasing latency and response time. Efﬁcient load balancing algorithms, such as dynamic scheduling and task partitioning, are essential for the optimal functioning of parallel processing systems. 5 Algorithm Analysis and Performance Comparison 5.1 Object Recognition Algorithms Object recognition is a crucial task in A Vs, as it allows the vehicle to identify and classify"

Modern A Vs use CNNs for object recognition due to their powerful ability to extract features from images and videos [ 1]. 5.1.1 Sequential Approach to Object Recognition The object recognition algorithm processes one image or video frame at a time within a sequential processing model. The inputs to this algorithm consist of the raw pixel values from each frame. It identiﬁes several key points of interest within the scene. Each frame is processed sequentially, starting from the input layer, then moving through convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and ﬁnally reaching the output layer, which classiﬁes the objects present. In contrast, autonomous vehicle systems distribute workloads across multiple CPUs connected by bus bars for signal and power distribution, often resulting in lengthy development times. While this approach is straightforward to implement, it is most suitable when developer time is less critical than performance. However, processing each frame in sequence can introduce signiﬁcant latency and delays, especially in real- time environments where speed is essential. 5.1.2 Parallel Approach to Object Recognition To improve the overall response time of the system, each processor manages its des-"

By concurrently processing multiple frames, the CNN signiﬁcantly reduces response time, achieving what is referred to as “real-time processing”.

Each sensor’s data is processed in parallel, with results soon to follow. For example, one core can handle camera data and another lidar data, while a third core works on radar information.

With the advent of sensor technology advancements, sensor fusion is a sophisticated ﬁeld that integrates many types of tech- nical devices [ 16–20]. It tries to use the strengths and match the weaknesses of each sensor, thus overcoming one-sensor data dependence. Sensor fusion is the process of accumulating and merging data from a variety of sensors to create a more comprehensive and accurate model of the system or environment [ 21]. Fig. 1.

The decision-making process involves analyzing the sensor data and running rules or machine learning models to select the best course of action. 5.3.1 Sequential Approach to Decision-Making In sequential decision-making, the system looks but once at each decision. The algorithm processes sensor data, evaluates potential courses of action and ﬁnally selects the best one in sequence. This method is often employed in traditional systems.

This capa- bility enables the system to react in real time to sudden changes and make a series of decisions at once, thereby ensuring safety in transportation and maximising efﬁciency while minimising waste [ 20]. Furthermore, parallel decision-making facilitates the concurrent evaluation of machine learning models across multiple processors, each analysing different outcomes to determine the optimal course of action.

Certainly, having all these in place means the vehicle can still operate safely even when the conditions are unusual or unpredictable. For an autonomous vehicle, robustness means that it retains good performance despite unexpected conditions and partial system failures. This is achieved through hardware and software redundancy, prediction of uncertainties in real time, as well as fallback strategies. A robust system does not just run well under normal conditions––it works out safely when sensors fail, data becomes noisy or rare scenarios are encountered. 5.3.3 Performance Comparison: Sequential vs Parallel When comparing the performance of sequential decision-making algorithms with those that execute actions in parallel, several key factors must be considered, as shown in Table 3: Table 3.

To understand this point, we will use traditional analytical performance models. Examples include Amdahl’s law, speedup factors, and basic computation mod- els for how time-critical operations such as object recognition can beneﬁt from parallel architecture. 6.1 Amdahl’s Law in Autonomous Systems Amdahl’s Law is a fundamental principle of parallel computing which explains how much one can potentially speed up a given task if certain portions are parallelized, as shown in Eq. ( 1) [13]. speedup = 1 (1 − P ) + P N (1) where P = proportion of the program that can be parallelized. N = number of processors. 1 – P = sequential portion of the task."

On a 4-core CPU: speedup = 1 (1 − 0.85) + 0 .85 4 = 2.66 x This gives us a speedup of 2,66× by using four cores – an amount quite signiﬁcant for real-time s ystems. 6.2 Speedup and Efﬁciency Metrics In real-time embedded systems, we should be just as concerned with how much improvement is getting through.

How do we address this requirement? We employ Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) as our framework for hard real-time systems, assigning priorities based on the frequency of tasks [ 13, 14]. For instance, Object detection, which occurs every 100 ms, is assigned a high priority in our scheduling algorithm. In contrast, path planning, which takes place only once every 500 ms, is assigned the lowest priority. By utilizing the RMS technique, high-priority tasks gain access to CPU and GPU resources ﬁrst. This scheduling model also allows us to calculate the worst-case response times effectively, as shown in Eq. 4. Ri = Ci + ∀j<i Ri Tj Ci (4) 530 S. Nesimi and E.

Ci = computation time. T j = period of higher-priority task j. In a Rate Monotonic Scheduling system, this value is used to evaluate the worst- case response time of any periodic task. At lower periods, jobs get higher priority [ 14]. The response time is that which starts from task release and lasts up until the point at which there have been all possible pre-emptions by higher-priority tasks. This formula is used to determine the worst-case response time of a periodic task in a hard real-time system where tasks are scheduled using rate-monotonic scheduling. Under RMS, tasks with shorter periods (i.e. higher frequency) are given higher priority. The response time includes that from when a task is released to when it completes, and any preemptions by higher priority tasks. Here, Pi is the period of task i. This formula helps check if a task is schedulable under Rate Monotonic Scheduling by calculating how long it might take in the worst case, including interference from higher-priority tasks. It is essential in real-time system design and ensures that critical tasks meet their deadlines.

The system spends more time fetching data than a Memory-bound model is considered, whereas if more ﬂoating-point operations are done than anything else, a Compute-bound model is used. In some examples, one might master this concept better depending on what input is given.

Parallel Processing for Real-Time Decision-Making in Self-driving Cars 531 8 Conclusion In this paper, we discussed the critical role of parallel processing in facilitating real- time decision-making for self-driving cars. A Vs rely on advanced technologies to effec- tively manage their extensive and intricate sensor data streams. Traditional sequential algorithms often struggle with slow response times and lack the ﬂexibility required for dynamic environments.

The study in [2] demonstrates that temperature and insulation aging sig- niﬁcantly inﬂuence moisture equilibrium in transformer systems, indicating that drying strategies must adapt dynamically to thermal and material aging conditions for effec- tive moisture removal.

In the [ 5] i s also underscored that both conventional and advanced drying techniques are essential for minimizing residual moisture and enhancing transformer lifespan. The importance of effective drying and moisture control in transformer insulation systems is well docu- mented in both research and standards.

Complementing this, [ 7] provides detailed procedures for measuring moisture in transformer insulation, highlighting best practices for sensor application and result interpretation to support predictive maintenance strate- gies.

The related work presented in the mentioned studies reinforces the importance of optimized drying, making it a foundational argument for introducing AI-enhanced drying methods. 1.2 Challenges in Traditional Drying Methods (Energy Intensity, Cost Inefﬁciencies) Traditional transformer drying methods, such as hot air circulation, vacuum oven dry- ing, and hot oil spray, have long been used to reduce moisture in insulation systems. However, these techniques present several challenges, notably high energy consumption, extended processing times, and signiﬁcant operational costs [ 5, 8]. The drying process often requires prolonged heating cycles to penetrate deep into cellulose insulation, lead- ing to thermal stress and potential damage if not properly controlled [ 9]. Moreover, con- ventional methods lack efﬁciency in moisture removal uniformity and frequently suffer from incomplete drying, especially in thick or multi-layered insulation structures [ 4, 10]. These inefﬁciencies underscore the need for improved or alternative drying techniques that offer greater control, lower energy requirements, and cost-effective operation. 536 L. Sandjakoska et al.

The author in [ 11] highlights the crucial role of advanced computational modeling in optimizing drying processes for improved energy efﬁciency, product quality, and process control. The study emphasizes the need for balancing model accuracy with computational cost and calls for stronger integration between simulations and experimental validation to enhance industrial appli- cability. The review points toward future integration of computational models with sensor data and control algorithms, enabling adaptive, smart drying systems based on real-time feedback. This encourages our research in that direction. As a continuation of this, Agh- bashlo et al. in [ 12] conclude that Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer a powerful, ﬂexible, and accurate approach for modeling complex drying processes, outperforming traditional empirical and theoretical models in many cases. Their ability to learn non- linear relationships between input parameters and drying outcomes makes them highly suitable for process prediction, optimization, and control. The review highlights that ANNs signiﬁcantly reduce the need for extensive experimentation, saving both time and resources.

The ﬁrst scenario includes a classiﬁcation model for the drying state based on the moisture content. The output of the classiﬁcation model is “wet”, “partially dry”, or “completely dry”. Moisture content depends inversely on temperature and drying time, and directly on humidity. We use Eq. ( 1) for estimating moisture content during the drying process, where • T = Temperature (in °C) AI-Driven Smart Drying 539 • H = Humidity (in % ) • t = Drying time (in minutes or hours, as appropriate) • ε ∼ N(0,σ2), where σ = 2, represents Gaussian noise • MC = Moisture content (in %) Then, the moisture content can be estimated as: MC = 100 − 0.5T + 0.3H − 0.05 t+ε(1) where ε ∼ N(0,4). This formula represents a linear model with stochastic noise, simu- lating how temperature, humidity, and drying time affect moisture content in a drying process. We also consider that moisture cannot be negative. In this scenario, we deﬁne the drying state based on moisture content. If the moisture content (MC in Eq. ( 1)) is more than 60%, then it is classiﬁed as “wet”; if it is more than 20% is “partially dry”, else is classiﬁed as “fully dry”. First, we train a regression model.

In the training process of the classiﬁcation model, we use 80% of the dataset, and 20% of the dataset is used for testing. The classiﬁcation report (Table 2) shows that the evaluation results reveal a signiﬁcant class imbalance, with the “Wet” class comprising the majority of the samples (191 out of 200), and the “Partially Dry” class having only 9 instances. While the model achieves high overall accuracy (approximately 95%) and excellent performance on the “Wet” class (precision = 0.96, recall = 0.99, F1-score = 0.98), its performance on the “Partially Dry” class is notably poor (precision = 0.67, recall = 0.22, F1-score = 0.33). This indicates that the model fails to correctly identify most “Partially Dry” instances. The macro-averaged scores (precision = 0.82, recall = 0.61, F1-score = 0.66) further highlight the disparity in performance between the classes. These results suggest that despite strong overall metrics, the model is biased toward the majority class and may not be reliable in detecting minority class cases, which could be critical in practical applications.

The train method is used to ﬁt both models on historical or simulated training data. The features used include temperature, humidity, pressure, AI-Driven Smart Drying 541 and drying time.

Controlling actuators of various types using the Internet has been a challenge in IoT. This allows electrical devices to be turned on and off from large geographical distances, which perform certain actions. The basic condition is to have access to the Internet and to have made the appropriate connection of the devices. One way to do this control is by using the ESP8266 sensor and the Arduino uno microcontroller. The devices are connected according to the appropriate scheme, the code is written and the same code is transferred to the Arduino uno microcontroller. Finally, testing is done.

IoT refers to the interconnection of everyday physical objects to the internet, enabling them to collect, exchange, and act on data without direct human intervention. This shift has revolutionized numerous sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, smart cities, transportation, and particularly home and industrial automation. At the core of IoT lies the ability to remotely monitor and control devices through computer networks. Among the many capabilities it offers, the control of actuators— devices responsible for executing physical actions such as turning on a light, opening a valve, or starting a motor is one of the most critical. Actuator control not only enhances convenience and safety but also allows for real-time automation, energy efﬁciency, and improved system responsiveness. The increasing availability of low-cost microcontrollers and wireless communication modules has signiﬁcantly lowered the barrier to entry for developing IoT systems. Com- ponents such as the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and open-source platforms like Arduino Uno have empowered hobbyists, researchers, and professionals to prototype and deploy IoT solutions with relative ease. The ESP8266, in particular, is valued for its compact form factor, built-in Wi-Fi capability, and compatibility with a wide range of development environments."

Components such as ESP8266 microprocessors and platforms such as Arduino have become essential for the creation of these systems due to their low cost, reduced power consumption, and ease of programming [ 1]. ESP8266 is a WiFi microprocessor that provides a powerful platform for wireless networking. It supports TCP/IP protocols and can function as a station or access point, allowing users to create localized net- works or connect directly to the Internet [ 2]. Arduino Uno, a microcontroller board based on the A Tmega328P , provides an open and ﬂexible development environment for the development of various automation applications. The use of Arduino facilitates the interconnection with sensors, actuators and other electronic components, which makes it suitable for the development of rapid prototypes in the context of IoT [ 1, 2, 5, 8, 10].

The use of relays to control high- voltage devices is a standard practice in automated systems. The integration of relays with microprocessor modules enables safe and reliable control of electrical devices remotely [ 6, 7]. Previous works have demonstrated successful implementations of ESP8266 for switching on/off lights or other home appliances via mobile and cloud applications [7, 8]. However, most of these studies focus on basic functionality and rarely address issues such as security, reliability, or long-term stability of the Internet connection. In this context, the current work comes as a practical contribution to the development of a simple but functional solution for controlling an actuator via the Internet, using the technologies mentioned above. It presents a concrete example of the integration of hardware and software components, which can serve as the basis for more complex environmental automation systems [ 3–10].

To assess the challenges and risks, information was collected on known IoT vulnerabilities and threat scenarios, then how they appear or could appear in the Albanian context was assessed. For international comparison, we identiﬁed and compared IoT security measures in the European Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK), United States (US) and neighboring Balkan countries through available ofﬁcial documents and regulations. Finally, we adopted a case study approach for illustrative purposes where two cases were selected: 1- Smart City project and 2- Involvement of IoT devices in botnet cyber-attacks.

IoT Security and Privacy in Albania 559 4.1 Iot Security and Privacy Challenges in Albania The IoT ecosystem in Albania faces many challenges, both technical and contextual, that increase security and privacy risks. Many devices in Albania exhibit the same problems evidenced globally, such as default passwords, outdated versions, lack of encryption, etc. Albania, being primarily an importing country, also brings in various technological devices, including IoT equipment. However, due to the absence of strict regulatory laws governing cybersecurity standards, there is a risk that some of these devices may not comply with recognized security requirements. One of the most common problems faced worldwide default passwords from IoT manufacturers. In developed countries like UK this has been regulated by law however this is not the case of Albania, which is not the case in Albania [ 7]. Another problem faced is the lack of awareness of users about IoT security, despite the ongoing efforts of National Cybersecurity Authority (NCSA) to raise awareness"

Another problem faced is the lack of awareness of users about IoT security, despite the ongoing efforts of National Cybersecurity Authority (NCSA) to raise awareness among the public and various sectors about the ﬁeld of cybersecurity. Privacy challenges are becoming more frequent due the increase in IoT implementation mainly due to the personal or sensitive data these devices collect. The previous Albanian law did not provide a comprehensive role in addressing the issue until the new law published in 2024 aligning with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). One of the examples that will be implemented in Albania is the 20 Smart City project, which has already started in 2023–2024. This project aims to monitor public spaces through Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and IoT cameras. Although this project brings a great progress in the ﬁeld of technology, security, IoT, etc., civil society groups see it as a problem as this could lead to mass surveillance of citizens. IoT cameras will collect large amounts of video data, posing a potential risk to privacy if this data is accessed by unauthorized persons. This case highlights the tension between innovation in IoT and privacy rights in Albania.

In conclusion, the risks of IoT in Albania stem from a combination of insecure devices, limited awareness, incomplete legal protection, and limited institutional over- sight. The need for intervention is deemed as urgent following the fact that these weaknesses will deepen with the increase in IoT adoption [ 9]. 4.2 International Comparisons: Albania vs Global Best Practices Comparing Albania with other countries for best practices in IoT security, Albania has made some progress but still has a long way to go. EU standards are important to implement as Albania approximates its laws to the EU. The EU’s approach to IoT security according to the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS2) directives has made Albania among the ﬁrst countries to adopt this essential law-standard in the 560 E.

So this is a very important step that puts Albania ahead of several countries in the region. The US, although it does not have a single law on IoT, has published sectoral guidelines and regulations. The US and the UK have published laws on government procurement of IoT, ensuring that every device purchased meets minimum security guidelines. North Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro have national cybersecurity strategies and laws similar to Albania, focusing on critical infrastructures and harmonization with the EU but without known speciﬁc provisions for IoT [10]. Regionally, there is an increase in cybersecurity capacity building programs within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NA TO) and the EU, which improves readiness. Albania ranks better than the region in many indices such as National Cybersecurity Index (NCSI), ITU, etc. [ 11]. International comparisons reveal gaps that Albania needs to address for improve- ment: 1. Establishing speciﬁc security requirements for IoT 2. Fully implementing data protection law, matching the rigor of the EU GDPR. 3. Expanding institutional capacity to follow practices such as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA). 4.3 Albania’s Cybersecurity Laws and Policies: Effectiveness and Gaps The main legislation on cybersecurity in Albania “Law no. 2/2017” laid the founda-"

This law obliged critical infrastructures to report incidents and implement cybersecurity measures. NCSA also played an important role as the lead institution to act as a national CSIRT. However, this law does not clearly address IoT devices or networks. IoT can be a weak point of this whole process because if we think of different cases like a country’s water system and if it is vulnerable then the damage can be great. The National Cyber Security Strategy 2020–2025 recognizes IoT as an emerging technology and leaves its objectives open to revision [ 12]. In the context of privacy, the old 2008 law on the protection of personal data was a major weakness and was not fully compliant with the standards of the GDPR. This was addressed in 2024 with the introduction of the new law that enforced in January 2025 where in case of data leaks the entity is obliged to inform. The main challenge will be to ensure that entities in the IoT space are aware and comply with the obligations.

Since there is no dedicated legislation, the national CSIRT may not treat these inci- dents as typical attacks, although specialized analysis may be required. This gap may reﬂect various ambiguities such as in incident handling procedures, limited coordina- tion with interested parties and possible delays in response. Regardless of how complex it may be in technical terms, various sectors may not receive the specialized attention IoT Security and Privacy in Albania 561 they may need. Consequently, the lack of a clear legal framework risks undermining the effectiveness of national security. In summary, Albania’s current cybersecurity framework provides a necessary foun- dation and progress is being made in this area by the NCSA, but there are signiﬁcant gaps in relation to IoT. The laws in force are somewhat general and reactive and lack speciﬁc provisions for IoT devices. Albania’s commitment to align its laws with those of the EU represents a very important step in this area. 4.4 Statistical Insights: IoT Security Incidents – Albania in Context Currently, there are no reliable concrete statistics available on IoT attacks in Albania."

However, incident data serves as a useful representation to assess the level of threat. In 2020, according to Atlas VPN’s analysis of Malware activity data, Albania accounted for 11.79% of all cyberattacks in Europe during a month, ranking 5th after countries such as Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine. In absolute terms, Albania corresponds to about 1.3 million attacks originating or targeting it. The data shows that Albania has a high rate of compromised systems per capita, many of which may be IoT endpoints [14]. To visualize the regional context, Table 1 shows the top ﬁve sources of cyberattacks in Europe (August-September 2020) and their percentage of total attacks: Table 1.

While 2022 saw a massive increase, this was considered a result of COVID-19 as a large part of people were working remotely [ 15]. Although data for our country on IoT incidents is limited, we can suggest that Alba- nia is likely to have experienced an increase in IoT-related events. Incidents occurring during the years 2020–2024 highlight that Albania is a target of both state-sponsored cyberattacks, which makes IoT devices vulnerable as entry points and targets for such 562 E. Kopani attacks. Statistical and incident evidence, although not very complete, shows a worry- ing picture for Albania in the context of cyber-attacks. Global trends in IoT threats are on a signiﬁcant increase, which makes it inevitable that they will also affect Albania. Thus, strengthening IoT security goes beyond the need for laws but requires a greater commitment to have a safer cyberspace. 4.5 Case Studies To further support our previous conclusions, we will examine two case studies: “Smart City Surveillance and Privacy” which highlights IoT privacy concerns and “Botnet Exploitation of Albanian IoT Devices” the other that illustrates IoT security vulnerabilities exploited for attacks.

The project involves installing a large network of IoT-connected CCTV cameras and creating monitoring and analysis centers for video streams. The government has billed the initia- tive as an investment in public safety and crime prevention in the country. However, the initiative has raised questions from human rights groups who argue that it could lead to mass surveillance of cities. Some of the concerns are presented as below: 1. The system violates privacy by continuously tracking individuals without clear limits or independent oversight 2. Albania lacks experience and speciﬁc legal frameworks, raising questions about how data will be stored, who can access it, and how abuse can be prevented 3. If the system is maintained by foreigners, who will have data sovereignty. This case highlights the privacy challenges of IoT in public governance in Albania. Although the new data protection law gives a push in the right direction, the need for concrete speciﬁcations is great. The impact of this case has been to increase public awareness and debate on privacy. This case could set a very good precedent if managed well with privacy protections and could demonstrate how IoT can enhance security responsibly. It can be shown that IoT can only truly improve when we make appropriate and governance improvements that are guided by strong ethical, legal standards and accountability mechanisms."

Case Study 2: Botnet Exploitation of Albanian IoT Devices. As reﬂected in the above statistics, Albania has had many devices used for IoT bot- nets. A similar case was observed around 2016–2017 during the wave of Mirai malware and subsequent IoT malware [ 17]. Cybersecurity researchers noticed signiﬁcant C&C attack trafﬁc from the Balkan region including Albania. In this case, many routers and IP cameras were infected due to unchanged default credentials and exposed ports. Identiﬁ- cation as a source of cyber-attacks could damage Albania’s reputation and cause many IPs to be blacklisted.

This analysis notes that the country is embracing IoT applications in government, the private sector and has begun to align its legal framework with the EU standards. On the other hand, current measures are insufﬁcient to address the threats posed by IoT, as shown by the country’s exposure to cyberattacks. In this section, we will integrate the ﬁndings to outline strategies for improvement, structured into three categories: 1. Legal and regulatory improvements 2. Technical and operational measures 3. Education and awareness initiatives Implementing these strategies in collaboration will signiﬁcantly strengthen the IoT security position in Albania. 5.1 Legal and Regulatory Strategies: Albania Albania should develop a more detailed regulatory regime speciﬁcally targeting the security of IoT devices. This could be achieved by adopting a speciﬁc law for IoT. This law could be design to reﬂect best practices from the EU, the US, and the UK, where minimum requirements are set, such as no default password or requiring the user to set a password upon ﬁrst use. In parallel, Albania should leverage its updated data protection law by issuing sector- speciﬁc guidelines for IoT that address risks such as data security, user consent, etc. While promoting safer environment this would align national effort with EU standards.

A key strategy is for Albania to improve its cyber defense capabilities with IoT in mind. NCSA should develop expertise in IoT threats. This could consist of setting up honeypots or sensors to detect IoT malware in Albanian networks and then collaborating with Electronic and Postal Communications Authority (EPCA) – Internet Service Provider (ISP) to identify injected IoT devices. Within government, critical and important sectors, it is recommended to conduct an inventory of IoT assets and assess their risk. This way we can have a clearer picture of the devices that need to be changed/improved. Secure procurement is another opera- tional point that has a gap. Government agencies in Albania must include cybersecurity requirements when purchasing any IoT or “smart” system. 564 E.

Within infrastructures and government, training for IT staff on IoT security needs to increase. Many network administrators do not have the proper skills to handle industrial IoT sensors and protocols. Finally, international cooperation and knowledge sharing can help raise awareness. Albania could invite experts from countries with advanced IoT security initiatives (such as the UK or Israel) to share experiences. Participation in EU research projects or regional exercises focused on IoT incidents will also highlight potential vulnerabilities in a secure environment. By pursuing legal reforms, technical protection and widespread education, Albania can signiﬁcantly strengthen its IoT security framework. The beneﬁts will be multiple: reduced incident rates, protection of citizens’ privacy which in turn builds trust in digital services, and alignment with EU norms that help Albania’s integration process. 6 Conclusion IoT technology is expected to play an increasingly important role in Albania’s devel- opment, from “Smart City” to business optimizations to end-users.

Technically speaking, while several layers of defenses have been built, perhaps the one layer of defense that keeps getting compromised and undermined is the human.

Human errors, unlike system failures or external attacks, are based on common behavioral patterns and decision processes, thus making them very unpredictable and difﬁcult to prevent [ 3]. On the contrary, these errors can have severe consequences when they affect information systems’ conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability, along with signiﬁcant ﬁnancial losses and reputational damage. Human error can lead to major cybersecurity incidents, such as data breaches and ransomware attacks, which reveal gaps in awareness, training, or system design. Rec- ognizing these systemic vulnerabilities, this paper examines key dimensions of human error in cybersecurity and proposes a structured approach to predict, evaluate, and mit- igate associated risks.

Speciﬁcally, we (i) identify predominant error categories, (ii) assess their operational impacts, and (iii) outline practical strategies—training, process redesign, and socio-technical controls—to reduce their frequency and severity. 2 Understanding Human Error in Cybersecurity Cybersecurity is often linked to ﬁrewalls and encryption, but human error can compro- mise even the most advanced systems. Despite rational thinking and cognitive biases, the decision-making is shaped by evolution and inﬂuenced by mindset, environment, and emotions. Attackers exploit these biases and behavioral patterns through social engineering to access sensitive data. According to a study done by IBM, astonishingly, 95% of security breaches are due to human error. Thus, that aforementioned fact emphasizes the part played by the ‘human element’ in the security of sensitive data [ 4]. An individual makes a human error when they accidentally make decisions or take actions that lead to a security breach. This can include something as simple as using a weak password or clicking on a phishing email, and unfortunately, some of these small mistakes can leave an organization open to a whole host of data threats. With advanced threats, the human factor remains the only position that is vulnerable. Report by ISPartners notes almost 49% of companies surveyed experienced breaches because of human errors with phishing (43%), poor password hygiene (30%), and acci- dental data sharing (28%) being the types of mistakes identiﬁed to be highly repeated [ 5]."

The importance of human error in security breaches is hardly rivalled. The more an organization entrusts its operations to digitally run systems and high technologies, the more human being is still one of the most uncertain factors concerning security. Even if one builds the most advanced security platforms, the employee, mostly as the ﬁrst line of defense, would still click on malicious links, fail to heed important security updates, or mishandle sensitive information. They could expose the digital infrastructure of the organization to potential compromise. Organizational issues like untrained staff, weak protocols, and pressure to prioritize productivity over compliance also contribute to cybersecurity risks. Often individuals are unaware of the impact of their actions, highlighting the need for increased cybersecurity awareness. Effective strategies must go beyond technical ﬁxes to include psychologi- cal and organizational behavioral changes. A study [ 6] showed that a human-centered approach, combining regular training, behavioral monitoring, and AI-assisted detection, 568 P . Risteski et al. signiﬁcantly improved security. Phishing errors dropped from 15–20% to 5–10%, pass- word misuse from 30–40% to 10–15%, and response times from 48–72 to 24–36 h. Moreover, the average cost of a breach was cut in half."

Security measures that comprise culture awareness, clear policies, and ongoing train- ing show improved engagement and security outcomes. These approaches would recog- nize that cybersecurity is not an issue solely for IT departments; it is a shared respon- sibility that spans the entire organization. The same conclusion has been drawn by other researchers who assert that cybersecurity risk goes beyond a technical solution and include the human and other organizational factors. It is found that if organizations want to manage cybersecurity risk or threats successfully, then there should be a cul- ture of cybersecurity, clear and consistent policies, and continual engaging training for employees at all levels [ 3]. 3 Impact on Information Systems Human error routinely defeats even well-engineered defenses and therefore represents a systemic risk to information systems. Mistakes such as clicking phishing links, weak or reused passwords, and misconﬁgurations can expose critical assets and disrupt essential services. In 2024, Change Healthcare ransomware attack, triggered by a phishing email, severely disrupted U.S. healthcare operations and highlighted system vulnerabilities [ 7]. Studies show human error causes about 26% of healthcare breaches, leading to signiﬁcant operational and ﬁnancial damage [ 8]. On average, such incidents cost $4.45 million, nearly matching the global breach average of $4.88 million in 2024 [ 9]."

Misconﬁgurations, especially in cloud environments, may expose data and violate compliance rules. For instance, publicly accessible cloud storage drives may allow unau- thorized access to sensitive information. Such breaches risk data integrity, lead to severe penalties, and damage an organization’s reputation. Beyond ﬁnes, businesses may suffer long-term effects like loss of customer trust. These incidents highlight the need for strong access controls and regular security audits to prevent damaging misconﬁgurations. These factors, according to [ 10], contribute to 80% of all data security breaches, while, pre- sumably, as high as up to 99% of cloud environment breakdowns will be attributable to human mishaps through 2025. These ﬁndings underscore the need for rigorous access controls, continuous conﬁguration auditing, and automated policy enforcement. However, the impact of the loss of ﬁnance is signiﬁcant in running information systems. It takes an average of 239 days to identify and contain human-induced breaches. During this time, systems often remain compromised or nonfunctional, affecting service delivery, decision-making, and stakeholder trust [11].

Under regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), breaches caused by humans, such as failure to encrypt sensitive personal data, can cost even up to e20 million or 4% of global turnover in ﬁnes, increasing the stakes for compliance and oversight [ 12]. In 2013, Target breach remains a key example of how human oversight and unpatched third-party systems can lead to catastrophic consequences. Attackers accessed Target’s network through a vulnerable third-party system, resulting in over $292 million in direct The Role of Human Error in Cybersecurity Threats 569 costs and a $1.58 billion loss in earnings due to reputational damage and remediation efforts [13].

Risteski et al. 4 Strategies to Minimize Human Risk The human errors often create openings for the most substantial potential damage to an organization’s defense, and continue to be one of the most signiﬁcant causes of vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. Therefore, it is necessary to start analyzing strategies that can reduce human-induced risks. Below are some of the effective strategies that an organization can adopt to minimize those risks: 4.1 Implementation of Robust Cybersecurity Training and Awareness Programs Phishing attacks are a major risk to organizations and individuals, causing ﬁnancial losses and data breaches. Phishing awareness can be seen as a learning process, where behavior is reinforced through targeted training, feedback, and corrective action. Falling for phishing is a key human error threat. Organizations should use proactive training, such as simulated phishing attacks, to educate employees and improve their ability to recognize and report suspicious emails [ 14]. The reinforced good habits, provide imme- diate feedback, and help reduce the risk of successful phishing attempts by addressing"

The reinforced good habits, provide imme- diate feedback, and help reduce the risk of successful phishing attempts by addressing human error [15–17]. Additionally, users should always install and keep updated security software, remain alert to current phishing trends, avoid suspicious links, and refrain from sharing personal information with strangers. Unique passwords and cautious behavior on social media are equally important. Educating users in phishing awareness is useful. However, such train- ing can be expensive and demands some minimal level of general knowledge regarding cybersecurity on the part of the user [ 18]. 4.2 Technical Solutions Two general approaches to technical solutions that detect and block phishing attacks are non-content-based and content-based approaches. An analysis of external characteristics of emails or websites, like URL structures, domain names, metadata, etc., falls under a non-content-based solution [ 18]. These often involve the use blacklist (blocking access to websites or email addresses already known to be dangerous) and whitelist (allowing access only to trusted and veriﬁed sources) where known malicious or trustworthy URL sources are considered for ﬁltering [ 19]. Content-based solutions analyze the actual content of messages, such as emails or websites, to determine if they are phishing or malicious attacks.

Often, machine learning, natural language processing, or rule-based ﬁltering are employed to ﬂag suspicious pieces of content [ 20]. While they are very effective against phishing attempts that were not caught by traditional ﬁltering techniques, content-based solutions have to be continuously updated to handle evolving techniques. 4.3 Use of AI-Driven Tools to Detect and Mitigate Human-Induced Vulnerabilities AI is a key strategy for reducing human error in cybersecurity, using intelligent algo- rithms and machine learning to enhance threat detection, prevention, and response. These The Role of Human Error in Cybersecurity Threats 571 systems analyze large datasets, detect patterns, and make rapid decisions beyond human capability. AI also automates tasks like log reviews and vulnerability scans, allowing analysts to focus on higher-level work. Crucially, AI enables real-time threat detection and faster incident response [21]. Moreover, these systems can adapt and change as they continue to learn from new data, improving their ability to identify and counter new threats. Phishing attacks traditionally rely on email ﬂooding with identical content, making detection easier through timing and similarity analysis. However, generative AI now enables attackers to create unique, realistic emails over time, making detection harder."

Researchers created a dataset of AI-generated phishing emails and tested AI-based text analysis tools, which successfully identiﬁed these advanced threats. These tools enhance phishing detection, improve email ﬁlters, monitor user behavior, and issue real-time warnings, helping both systems and users adapt to evolving tactics [ 22]. AI systems can continuously learn and adapt, helping reduce human mistakes and making users more resilient against evolving threats. To combat human-caused vulnerabilities like insider threats and compromised cre- dentials, organizations use User Entity Behavior Analysis (UEBA) across all connected devices, including corporate, employee-owned devices, and home routers for remote access. UEBA ﬁrst establishes a baseline of normal behavior by analyzing application use, communication patterns, and network access. Once the baseline is set, machine learning algorithms monitor for anomalies, such as unusual login times or abnormal data access. For example, if a user who typically downloads 20 MB of ﬁles suddenly downloads 4 GB, the system can ﬂag this as an anomaly and alert IT or automatically disconnect the user from the network [ 23]. 4.4 Designing User-Centric Security Systems to Reduce Errors Creating user-centered security systems is key to minimizing human errors that lead to"

As threats grow more sophisticated, systems must consider human factors like behavior, cognitive limits, and usability. A user-focused approach improves security effectiveness and reduces errors caused by misperception or frustration. This involves strategies such as: Simplifying Authentication Mechanisms. Frictionless authentication methods like Single Sign-On (SSO), passwordless logins, and adaptive authentication enhance both security and user experience. SSO streamlines access by allowing one login for multi- ple applications, improving efﬁciency. Passwordless authentication replaces static pass- words with biometrics, cryptographic keys, or proximity methods, reducing credential- related risks [ 24]. Adaptive authentication uses contextual factors—like location, device, and behavior—to assess risk, prompting extra veriﬁcation only when needed. This dynamic approach ensures secure access while minimizing inconvenience for legitimate users [ 25]. Intuitive User Interfaces.

Adaptive Security Measures. Automated, AI-driven security controls adjust authen- tication based on real-time risk, balancing security with user convenience. Behavioral authentication uses adaptive AI to analyze patterns like keystrokes and voice to detect anomalies and verify identity. Unlike static methods, adaptive AI evolves with user behavior, reducing risks like credential theft and spooﬁng while maintaining a seamless experience [ 27]. Combined with multi-layered authentication, it offers robust security without sacriﬁcing usability. 4.5 Proposed Human Error Mitigation Framework To better understand and address the role of human error in cybersecurity, we propose the GRIT Framework—a four-stage model that maps the path from human-originated causes to structured organizational responses (see Fig. 1). The stages are: Genesis, Real- ization, Impact, and Treatment. The framework is designed to model how error evolves from latent conditions into actionable mitigation strategies.  The Genesis stage captures the root causes of error, focusing on individual level vari- ables such as stress, fatigue, distraction, overconﬁdence, and lack of security aware-"

These variables represent the human–system interaction layer.  The Impact stage identiﬁes the resulting security outcomes—data loss, increased attack surfaces, regulatory violations, and prolonged recovery times—that stem from these errors. Impact can be measured in terms of severity (e.g., high-risk vs. low-risk consequences) and scope (e.g., local vs. systemic effect).  Finally, the Treatment stage outlines how organizations can respond through four tar- geted approaches: Integrated Security Training (role-adapted and behaviour-speciﬁc), Responsive Interface Design (aligned with common error patterns), Intelligent Behav- ior Monitoring (e.g., UEBA-based anomaly detection), and Tailored Security Policies that dynamically adjust to user roles, access levels, and threat contexts.

In comparison, recent academic frameworks addressing human error in cybersecurity emphasize a range of interdisciplinary strategies, yet many lack an integrated structure for modeling error progression. The framework in [2] integrates psychological resilience, adaptive training, and ethical AI principles, addressing gaps like generational diversity and organizational misalignment, yet it focuses mainly on educational and policy-level The Role of Human Error in Cybersecurity Threats 573 interventions. Similarly, [ 28] combines Systems Intelligence (SI) and Human Factors (HF) to incorporate subjective experience into safety-critical decision-making, but does not explicitly link human error causes to risk outcomes in a lifecycle-aligned way. By contrast, the GRIT Framework presents a stage-based structure—Genesis, Realization, Impact, and Treatment—that traces error from root cause to organisational response. Inte- grating behavioral and organizational variables in a dynamic sequence, GRIT enables more targeted planning and bridges proactive and reactive security processes.

Success Stories from Cybersecurity Training - Google Case Study. In early 2017, Google implemented physical security keys using Universal Second Factor (U2F) authentication for over 85,000 employees, replacing less secure OTP methods. The results were striking: since the rollout, Google reported zero successful phishing attacks against its employees. The company has since expanded its use of FIDO protocols across enterprise and consumer authentication [ 29]. A two-year study showed a 3% failure rate for OTPs, compared to 0% for U2F keys [ 30], proving the effectiveness of physical security keys in preventing phishing threats. Technical Solutions Implemented by British Airways. The 2018 British Airways data breach exposed personal and payment information of nearly 400,000 customers due to vulnerabilities in the airline’s website. The absence of client-side security tools and real- time ﬁle integrity monitoring contributed to the attack [ 30].

Several organizations use avail- able AI tools to prevent human-induced accidents. For instance, Google uses AI via Gmail to block phishing emails before users click dangerous links [ 33]. IBM’s security 574 P . Risteski et al. system, QRadar, uses AI to ﬁlter through security alerts and help banks quickly identify real threats [34]. Companies such as Darktrace utilize AI to scout for any unusual activ- ities, like an employee trying to access ﬁles they shouldn’t be able to view [ 35].

This new type of warfare is a continuous and ongoing threat as it is not limited by territory and can be initiated from any location on the planet. Since computer networks are now the foundation of almost every aspect of life, from communication to commercial and defense networks, national security organizations worldwide have placed cybersecurity at the top of their agendas [ 1]. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026 K.

APTs differ from other forms of cyberattacks. They are persistent and comprise highly motivated and well-funded attackers who aim to inﬁltrate and achieve a hidden presence within an organization’s networks. APTs present a signiﬁcant risk to national security because they are highly sophisticated, adaptive, and usually challenging to detect. For months or years, APTs can go undetected, progressively steal- ing sensitive information or disrupting critical infrastructure. Due to APTs’ ability to inﬁltrate critical systems like communications, defense networks, and power grids, the rising sophistication of the threats has led to serious vulnerabilities in national security."

They have a profound effect and can undermine national sovereignty and destabilize economies [ 2]. In combating cyber threats, such as APTs, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has emerged as an effective weapon. AI systems can quickly scan through massive volumes of data, identify anomalies, and reveal patterns of malicious intent. Through the integration of AI into cybersecurity, countries can strengthen their capacity to foresee, detect, and eliminate threats before they can cause critical harm. Creating AI agents—computer programs that are partially or fully autonomous is revolutionizing cybersecurity. The agents provide round-the-clock and adaptive protection by not only guarding against attacks but also learning from new forms of attacks that cyber adversaries utilize. AI’s contribution to national defense is becoming more critical as cyber threats endure and evolve, providing new mechanisms to strengthen security and fend off increasingly sophisticated and persistent attacks [ 3]. 2 Literature Review 2.1 Cyber Warfare and Its Changing Threat Proﬁle The nature of cyberwar has shifted signiﬁcantly over the past 20 years, becoming a more advanced and complex activity.

Developing more advanced and subtle capabilities has altered the nature of cyber warfare. One of the earliest documented examples of cyberwar is the 2007 cyber-attack on Estonia, which was launched against banking and government networks and made the nation’s digital infrastructure unusable for weeks. It woke us to the reality of cyberwar and showed how debilitating cyberattacks can be to the operations of a country [ 3–5]. The 2010 Stuxnet attack, which targeted Iran’s nuclear program and caused severe damage to centrifuges by taking advantage of weaknesses in industrial control systems, is one of the more recent and well-known examples. Most agree that Stuxnet was the ﬁrst cyberweapon to inﬂict physical harm on humans. The 2020 SolarWinds hack, in which a highly sophisticated APT gang breached a software vendor utilized by numerous cor- porate and government entities in the United States, is another well-publicized incident. The attackers went undetected for several months, breaching critical infrastructure and stealing conﬁdential information [ 4, 5]. These examples highlight the evolving nature of cyberwarfare, where adversaries target critical and conventional IT infrastructure. 580 R.

V adisetty et al. 2.2 Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) One type of cyber threat that suggests a more strategic, longer-term trajectory for cyber- attacks is referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). APT organizations attempt to inﬁltrate targeted destinations and achieve a persistent presence over a long duration of time. They are generally state-sponsored, well-funded, and well-organized. APT orga- nizations employ a variety of tactics, most of which are advanced. One of the most prevalent tactics is spear-phishing, in which criminals use specially created emails to dupe recipients into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links. Another common tactic is Zero-day exploits, previously unknown software vulnerabilities that attackers use before they are found and patched [ 5, 6]. The 2017 NotPetya attack, which targeted Ukraine squarely and was attributed to a Russian APT group, is a good example of a case study. It caused extensive economic damage by targeting banking systems, government networks, and businesses with a mixture of ransomware and destructive payloads. The 2015 United States Ofﬁce of Personnel Management (OPM) breach is an excellent example of an APT campaign. Chinese hackers could exﬁltrate millions of federal employees’ personal information, including security clearance information [ 7–9]. Because APTs can be used to target networks in the public and commercial sectors for data theft or operational disruption, these attacks demonstrate the potential impact of APTs on national security."

AI is applied throughout cybersecurity, from incident response and recovery to threat detection and prevention. Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) algorithms help deal with enormous amounts of data and recognize patterns that may signify the presence of an attack. By analyzing anomalies in system behavior, these AI applications can be trained to identify existing threats and new, unfamiliar attack methods [ 8–10]. AI-powered security solutions, for instance, can identify anomalous network traf- ﬁc patterns that could indicate a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack or other cyberattack. AI-powered behavioral analysis techniques are also utilized to identify anomalous behavior by authorized users that could indicate an insider threat or compro- mised account. V endors like Darktrace have set the standard for AI-powered solutions by learning and adapting automatically to network environments to identify cyber threats in real-time [ 9]. However, there are also downsides to the application of AI in cybersecurity. Among its most signiﬁcant downsides is the likelihood of false positives, in which harmless activity is identiﬁed as a potential threat. This leads to needless alerts and operational"

This leads to needless alerts and operational inefﬁciencies. Adversarial attacks, in which cyber attackers target AI models to avoid detection or compromise operations, can also affect AI systems. These issues demand additional research to enhance AI-driven cybersecurity solutions’ accuracy, reliability, and robustness [ 10]. In conclusion, though AI can potentially transform cybersecurity as a whole, its use for addressing the issue of APTs should be viewed in light of its vulnerabilities and the Cyber Warfare and AI Agents 581 dynamic nature of online threats. As cyberwarfare intensiﬁes and advances, AI will play a more signiﬁcant role in national defense. However, its vulnerabilities and strengths should be appreciated for their most effective use in APT defense. 3 AI Agents in Cybersecurity To ensure AI agents are perfectly equipped to handle their cybersecurity tasks, a focus on adversarial attack countermeasures and the minimization of false positives is required. Adversarial attacks attempt to disrupt AI models by incorporating subtle changes to input data, which can undermine accuracy in producing viable threat targets.

In addition, it should be highlighted how neural network models, especially machine learning like deep learning methods such as auto-encoders and recurrent neural networks (RNN), can identify novel forms of attack peaks through modeling based on patterns over time, like ﬂuctuation with rate of occurrence. Finally, while false alerts presents a serious challenge in AI enabled cybersecurity, solutions involving ensemble methods utilizing multiple models and thresholding approaches to anomaly detection can signiﬁcantly decrease false positives while maintaining ability monitor new forms of attacks while implementing explainable AI (XAI) frameworks, such as SHAP or LIME, can assist in making AI more beneﬁcial in AI enabled cybersecurity since they provide transparency to security analysts regarding activities that have been ﬂagged as threatening to assist in problem-sensing and prioritization. 3.1 Types of AI Agents AI agents in cybersecurity enhance threat detection and response by automating pro- cesses.

Though effective at preventing known threats, they are less effective at avoiding com- pletely new, never-before-seen attacks and, hence, are insufﬁcient to stop advanced, dynamic APTs [ 11].  Anomaly-based AI Detection Systems differ from signature-based systems in iden- tifying threats based on deviations from deﬁned baseline behavior. By continuously monitoring network trafﬁc or user activity, the agents can detect anomalous behavior that doesn’t ﬁt the standard patterns. It is more adaptable to APTs because it is key to uncovering new or novel attack techniques [ 11].  Cybersecurity Autonomous AI Agents: These AI agents utilize sophisticated meth- ods like machine learning and deep learning to detect and respond to online threats 582 R.

By studying trends and assault patterns, the agents can predict potential attacks and provide a proactive defense. 3.3 Advantages of AI in Combating APTs In the ﬁght against APT, AI agents offer the following advantages:  Speed and Accuracy in Threat Detection: AI systems are quicker than traditional threat detection and response methods as they can process massive volumes of data in real-time.

Problems from their reliance on quality data, susceptibility to adversarial attacks, and concerns with privacy and false positives would all undermine their effectiveness. These vulnerabilities demand ongoing development and reﬁnement of AI technology. Cyber Warfare and AI Agents 585 Fig. 1. Evaluation of AI agents in APT detection. The most striking features in Fig. 1 are the accuracy and detection rate of AI agents in the real-world cybersecurity context. The ﬁrst graph (Evaluation of AI Agents in APT identiﬁcation) shows how AI agents are a valuable cyber defense system since they excel at high accuracy and detection rates in threat detection. Speciﬁcally, AI’s ability to accurately detect cyber threats in real time provides an immense advantage in preventing the large-scale devastation of APTs on critical infrastructure. However, Fig. 2 also reveals the remaining space for improvement, particularly in reducing the rate of false positives and missed detections. The relatively low failure rates shown in the graph, including the 5% rate of missed detection and 8% rate of false positives, imply the need for ongoing development and improvement of AI systems to eradicate such failures. While AI systems have the potential to respond to threats and detect them on their own, the occurrence of false positives can result in irrelevant alerts and resource wastage. In contrast, missed detection can result in critical vulnerabilities"

Keywords: Multi-Agent Systems · AI-Driven Security · Cloud Security · Threat Detection 1 Introduction Cloud computing has fundamentally reshaped how organizations provision and consume IT resources. Researchers describe it as delivering the “illusion of inﬁnite resources on demand,” allowing workloads to scale within seconds and eliminating the need for large hardware purchases [ 1, 2]. Even better, you only pay for what you use, turning massive hardware budgets into manageable monthly fees [ 3]. Because those servers live in data-centres scattered around the globe, your app can stay online even if one region goes dark, and your team can reach it from any device, anywhere [ 2]. Large providers also concentrate specialized security talent and automated safeguards, and recent surveys report faster incident-response times and improved regulatory compliance after migration to the cloud [ 4, 5]. These same features, however, greatly expand the attack surface. Multi-tenancy, ubiquitous APIs and rapid deployment pipelines generate vast telemetry streams and rapidly evolving threats that overwhelm monolithic, centrally managed defenses [ 5]."

The challenges tend to fall into three interconnected areas: scalability, agility, and resilience. Centralized systems, for instance, often struggle to keep up with the sheer volume of real-time data ﬂowing in from multiple sources. A security operations center might become overwhelmed trying to monitor everything at once, making it easier for threats to slip through unnoticed.

At the same time, signature-based tools designed to detect known attack patterns can’t move fast enough to keep pace with the new, often unpredictable tactics used by today’s cyber attackers. And when everything depends on a single point of control, even one failure like a compromised central server can expose the entire system to risk. This is where MAS come in. Rather than relying on a central authority, MAS dis- tribute responsibility across a network of autonomous agents. Each one watches over its local environment, responds to unusual activity in real time, and shares information with the others. This decentralized setup makes it easier to scale, because the data is processed close to where it’s generated. It also allows for quicker, more adaptive responses to new threats and removes the risk of a single failure bringing down the entire defense. In this way, MAS offer a security model that ﬁts the evolving nature of cloud infrastructure more ﬂexible, more collaborative, and more capable of keeping up. 590 A. Gjini et al. 3 MAS as a Conceptual Solution MAS frameworks operate by distributing security functions such as detection, analysis, and response across a network of autonomous agents. Rather than relying on a single control point, these systems embrace decentralization, which eliminates a major vulner- ability: the risk of total failure if a central node is compromised.

Each agent is designed with a speciﬁc role in mind some monitor system activity, others assess anomalies or carry out remediation bringing a layer of task-speciﬁc specialization that makes the over- all system more efﬁcient and responsive. Many MAS implementations also incorporate machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning or supervised learning, which enable agents to adapt their behavior over time based on experience and evolv- ing threat patterns. This adaptability is particularly valuable in environments where the threat landscape shifts rapidly. Additionally, MAS frameworks are inherently scalable which they can be deployed across cloud and edge infrastructures alike by making them well-suited for modern, and distributed computing environments. What makes MAS especially compelling to us as researchers and educators is how closely they mirror the dynamics of collaborative academic work. Much like a research team, each agent contributes a specialized skill set, learns from continuous feedback, and coordinates with others to arrive at a robust, system-wide solution. This analogy did more than simply help us conceptualize MAS it actively shaped our approach to analyzing the frameworks presented in this review.

These were chosen based on their relevance, diversity of techniques, and focus on different problems such as intrusion detection, privacy, and agent collaboration. Each work was analyzed in terms of design, AI methods, and effectiveness. 4.1 Architectures and Agent Roles Authors at [ 7] introduced Intelligent Security Service Framework (ISSF), a deep RL- based framework simulating attacker-defender interactions in cloud environments. While promising, ISSF was only tested in simulated settings; real-world evaluation and compu- tational cost remain concerns. Authors at [ 8] proposed a distributed MAS for cloud-edge workﬂows using federated learning. The authors note challenges in scaling inter-agent communication and optimizing agents for constrained devices.

In our work with cloud-based research labs and small-scale deployments, we have noticed that hybrid designs like Ethan & Noah’s are more feasible in practice, offering a balance between decentralization and control. Fully distributed systems, while theoret- ically appealing, demand sophisticated infrastructure and maintenance, which can be a barrier for adoption outside tech giants. 4.2 Anomaly Detection and AI Techniques Qin et al.

While the model achieved strong F1 scores, the authors acknowledge communication overhead and vulnerability to adversarial inputs. Gu et al.

While accurate and low in false positives, it still relies on centralized training and has limited evaluation against novel attacks. The sophistication of these AI techniques reﬂects a maturation in how MAS operate. As researchers and instructors, we ﬁnd the integration of LLMs particularly promising, not only for their predictive capabilities but also for their ability to generate explainable outputs. This enhances trust in automated decisions, a critical factor when deploying MAS in sensitive sectors like healthcare or ﬁnance. 4.3 Game-Theoretic and Adversarial Defense Authors at [15] have used a dueling DQN framework in a simulated adversarial setting for NGNs. Their IDS adapted well to intelligent threats, outperforming baselines. However, the system was tested only in simulated environments, and real-world scalability is still uncertain. This incorporation of adversarial simulations is essential for training robust MAS agents. However, results from simulated environments should be interpreted with caution until validated in live systems. 4.4 Comparative Summary This section presents a side-by-side comparison of selected MAS-based frameworks, highlighting their architectural design, focus areas, applied AI techniques, as well as their key strengths and limitations.

One major issue is balancing scalability with com- munication overhead. While federated MAS architectures reduce the burden on cen- tral nodes, they introduce signiﬁcant coordination demands. As the number of agents increases, so does the need for secure and efﬁcient communication, which can lead to network congestion and latency [ 16]. Generalization is another concern. Many MAS models are tailored to speciﬁc sce- narios such as intrusion detection or load balancing, and often lack the ﬂexibility to perform well in unfamiliar environments without extensive retraining or redesign.

Gjini et al. limits their practicality in dynamic, real-world cloud ecosystems, especially in domains like cloud robotics and decentralized resource management [ 17]. MAS also raise concerns around adversarial vulnerability. Agents trained through reinforcement learning can be manipulated by poisoned inputs or deceptive reward sig- nals, potentially leading them to adopt harmful behaviors. In critical systems, this creates serious security risks that are difﬁcult to detect and mitigate. Authors at [ 18] highlight these vulnerabilities and the unique difﬁculty of securing multi-agent reinforcement learning environments. The use of opaque models, especially in LLM-based agents, also brings forward ques- tions of ethics and explainability. Without transparent reasoning, it becomes difﬁcult for system administrators to understand or audit decisions, complicating accountability. As MAS take on greater responsibility, ensuring their actions are interpretable and aligned with human values becomes essential [ 19]. From a practical standpoint, tooling gaps also create friction in real-world use. Most MAS still lack robust interfaces for monitoring and debugging behaviors at scale.

Authors at [ 20–23] highlight this persistent challenge, proposing the use of design artifacts such as interaction protocols to support more effective debugging. Their work emphasizes the need for systematic tooling that not only logs agent actions but also maps them against intended design ﬂows. While foundational, this approach is still not widely adopted in contemporary MAS frameworks, and more mature, developer-friendly tools remain an open area for improvement. Addressing these open issues scalability, generalization, security, transparency, and tooling will be key to unlocking the full potential of MAS in cloud security. 6 Conclusion MAS have evolved from conceptual tools into practical, distributed defense systems capable of intelligent, real-time threat detection and response. This review shows that the current generation of MAS frameworks integrate advanced AI (e.g., RL, LLMs, GANs) and are increasingly applied in edge, cloud-native, and hybrid systems. Nonetheless, widespread deployment requires addressing coordination, standardiza- tion, and explainability. Future research should focus on cross-agent trust, transparent decision-making, and uniﬁed benchmark frameworks.

This paper explores the integration of Federated Learning with autonomous driving simulation using the CARLA simulator, the YOLO object detection algorithm, and the Jetson Nano as a representative edge device. Syn- thetic data were extracted from CARLA simulations, with annotations converted to the YOLO format, eliminating the need for manual labeling. The proposed approach allows multiple vehicles to locally train object detection models using camera video streams and subsequently aggregate their parameters through a Fed- erated Learning mechanism, without sharing raw data.

However, to achieve reliable and intelligent decision-making, A Vs must accurately perceive their surroundings in real time, including the recognition of trafﬁc signs. Trafﬁc sign recognition (TSR) is a criti- cal component of the perception stack, but it poses signiﬁcant challenges due to varying lighting conditions, occlusions, adverse weather, and region-speciﬁc sign variations. Conventional deep learning-based TSR systems typically rely on centralized architec- tures that aggregate training data on a central server. While effective in terms of model performance, centralized learning requires extensive data transmission, raising serious concerns about user privacy, communication overhead, and scalability, particularly in intelligent transportation systems where data is continuously generated at the edge. To address these limitations, this work proposes a decentralized trafﬁc sign recog- nition pipeline based on federated learning (FL), edge computing, and synthetic data generation. FL is a privacy-preserving learning paradigm where model training occurs locally on edge devices and only model parameters are shared with a central aggrega- tor.

This makes it especially suitable for edge AI applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and smart surveillance, where low latency and energy efﬁciency are crucial. To support the training process without the burden of collecting and labeling real- world trafﬁc data, the CARLA simulator is employed to generate synthetic trafﬁc scenes. Synthetic data mitigates the need for time-consuming manual annotation, and to fully automate this step, CARLA outputs are programmatically converted into YOLO- compatible annotations. YOLO (Y ou Only Look Once) is chosen for its speed and accuracy, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices with real-time constraints.

This study aims to ﬁll that gap by designing and evaluating a federated learning- based TSR pipeline that operates on edge devices, requires no manual annotation thanks to automated labeling from simulation, preserves data privacy by avoiding raw data transfers and demonstrates scalability in terms of the number of participating devices, with low communication overhead and acceptable model convergence across nodes.

RGB images and segmentation masks were recorded in sync at ﬁxed frame intervals, with matched ﬁlenames ensuring frame alignment. Semantic masks were post-processed to isolate trafﬁc signs by class. Each region was enclosed in a minimum bounding rectangle, and coordinates were normalized to image dimensions, yielding YOLO-compatible bounding box parameters. Class labels were mapped to numeric indices based on a predeﬁned list. Each image was paired with a text ﬁle containing bounding box annotations in the format of “class index, x center, y center, width, height”. A Y AML ﬁle specifying image paths, class count, and class names completed the YOLO v5 dataset structure. The resulting dataset, comprising images, annotations, and conﬁguration, was used directly for training, allowing efﬁcient ﬁne-tuning and evaluation of detector performance on synthetic CARLA-generated data. 2.3 Federated Model Aggregation The training process is carried out iteratively: after local training, models from each device send updated weights to the server, which then uses the FedAvg algorithm to aggregate and form a shared model. The central server does not have access to the actual data from the edge devices; it only utilizes their representations in the form of weight parameters.

After aggregation, the new global model is distributed back to the devices, which use it for the next training cycle, repeating the process.

IoU Score and Inference Latency Distributions The Intersection over Union (IoU) distribution further characterizes localization quality. Notably, 20.90% of predictions achieved IoU scores between 0.7 and 0.8, while 58.50% of predictions fell within the range of 0.6 to 0.9. Expanding this range to 0.5 to 1.0, which is generally considered an acceptable threshold for successful detection, 79.00% of predictions met this criterion. These results suggest that the majority of detections are well localized, with a signiﬁcant portion of predictions closely matching ground truth bounding boxes. In terms of inference performance, the average latency was measured at 13.81 ms, corresponding to an average frame rate of approximately 72.39 frames per second (FPS). This demonstrates the system’s capability to operate in real- time conditions, meeting practical requirements for trafﬁc sign detection in autonomous driving or driver assistance applications.

In practice, this means it can process video frames in real time on resource-constrained hardware, a strength not seen in higher-accuracy models that run at only ~ 10–40 FPS on similar devices [ 12–14]. Thus, the federated system trades some accuracy for excellent throughput, making it well-suited to real-time edge deployment. 4 Conclusion These ﬁndings highlight a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efﬁciency. The achieved mAP and IoU distributions conﬁrm reliable detection performance, while the low latency and high FPS underline the suitability of the model for deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources. The methodology combining transfer learning, federated learning, and synthetic data generation proves effective in training an accurate and efﬁcient trafﬁc sign detector. Future work will integrate the trafﬁc sign detection model into a large-scale system for automatic identiﬁcation of trafﬁc congestion and bottlenecks. By combining real- time detection with geospatial clustering methods from [ 15], the system aims to improve trafﬁc analysis and enhance the scalability of urban monitoring solutions. Acknowledgments.

Still, because of the complexity and the need for continuous monitoring, deployment can be costly and labor-intensive [ 6–8]. 2.4 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Supply Chains Artiﬁcial intelligence, particularly machine learning, has been crucial in optimizing supply chain activity. Machine algorithms can examine vast data sets to foretell demand patterns, increase levels of inventory, and improve logistics. For example, retailers like Walmart and Starbucks leverage AI to improve forecasting levels of demand, and supply chains are more adaptable to changes in the availability of products.

The trained model, having a performance space that applied when consistent, was saved for future use every 50 episodes. Policy rollouts were retained above when agent performance was consistent, for evaluation after training. 3.7 Evaluation Criteria The effectiveness of AI-based resource allocation measures is quantiﬁed in metrics such as system efﬁciency, cost saving, scalability, and rapid response. System efﬁciency met- rics are based on reduced processing time, computational overhead, and processing cost cutback. The cost-saving measures are designed to compare cost and resource usage pre- and post-implementing AI-based allocation methods. The scalability measures observe the system’s ability to accommodate increased workload, and response measures are designed using the system’s ability to follow changing supply chain requirements within a limited time.

The rules-based model was based on an arbitrary set of rules, such as FIFO (First-In-First-Out), and equal allocation to each demand node. In the threshold model, resources were activated only when demand exceeded certain thresholds, with the result being that we often saw severe underutiliza- tion and overutilization. The genetic algorithm model evolved near-optimal allocation policies based on evolutionary principles; however, we discovered signiﬁcant slow con- vergence, and ﬂexible adaptation to real-time changes was very inconsistent. The agentic AI model outperformed all three baseline models in the three key metrics - we noted 25% greater operational efﬁciency, 30% greater reduction in total cost, and 15% enhanced scalability as previously reported.

Modern motion picture coding heavily relies on intra/inter-frame similari-ties/correlation. Exploitation of possible similarities is done by searching and ref-erencing the most similar previously coded and transmitted frame parts called blocks. In current algorithms, a single reference block is pointed at by a motion vector per a block in the frame currently being coded. In this paper, we evaluate the picture quality advantages of using multiple reference blocks within a previ-ous frame. That is, a single block is represented by a weighted sum of previously transmitted two or three blocks. Weights are tabulated using clustering techniques and represented by a few bits corresponding to weight index. The pro- posed method leads to a gain of 1.5 dB on average, at the cost of a couple of extra bits to transmit and added complexity for calculating the weights on the encoder side.

Although HEVC inherits most of the main parts of A VC, HEVC does more efﬁcient video compression than A VC when dealing with 4K or above resolutions. HEVC can achieve the same quality as A VC with up to %64 higher efﬁciency in bit rate [2]. It reaches this efﬁciency through improvements in various steps of the compression ﬂow. For instance, use of 64 × 64 macro blocks (MB) leads to much greater bit-rate savings in high resolution v ideos. Motion estimation is one of the steps that help improve bit-rate savings.

Researchers at [ 5, 6] noted that the motion vectors of a video frame can be predicted as a continuation or similarity of the motion vectors in previous frames. It was observed that using ﬁxed motion vectors for a block in prediction mode increased coding efﬁciency.

It was noted that the prediction error decreased for small quanti- zation parameters. However, at high quantization parameters, the preference for multiple references diminished, reducing their effect. As the prediction error decreased, the bit requirement for encoding the residue blocks was reduced, which increased the capacity to send additional information. However, the approach increased computational cost, which is considered one of its weaknesses [ 15]. Chen et al. developed a generalized bi- prediction improvement.

An average gain of 1.1% was achieved, though the encoding process took twice as long [ 16]. Chen et al. developed a method at the coding block level that could choose between the proposed weighted prediction and a mean area mode. The weighting of the refer- ences was based on the distance of the frames containing the reference blocks relative to the current frame. The weights for partitioning were calculated based on the ratios of these frame distances such that their sum was 16. Experimental results indicated that for CIF/240p video sets, the proposed method achieved average gains of 1.59 PSNR and 1.22 SSIM, and for four CIF/480p video sets, average gains of 1.48 PSNR and 1.12 SSIM were achieved [ 17].

After performing bi-prediction calculations, addi- tional motion estimation was carried out for an extra reference. In calculating the weight parameters for this additional reference, rate–distortion cost, SAD, and an approximate bit rate were used. Motion estimation was repeated until either a lower rate–distortion cost than the best found was achieved or a limit on the number of additional references was reached. It was noted that adding more than two extra references reduced the coding gain. It was observed that the coding performance obtained with adaptively determined additional weights was better than that achieved with ﬁxed weights, particularly at high bit rates [ 18]. Li et al. proposed a method based on using multiple reference blocks, where the motion vectors of the added reference blocks were obtained from vectors already available at the decoder. For weighting the references, three different approaches were used: arithmetic mean weighting, weighting based on the distance between the reference frame and the frame containing the block to be encoded, and weighting based on the sum of the differences in pixel values between the reference block and the block to be encoded. Compared with the A V1 reference software, an average reduction of 0.8 in the Bjontegaard delta metric was achieved, with some data sets reaching up to 3%. These results were obtained with a 20% increase in the encoder’s running time [ 19]."

These studies collectively demonstrate the evolution of weighted prediction and multiple reference techniques, emphasizing their potential to enhance compression efﬁ- ciency. While improvements in PSNR and BD-rate are consistent themes, the trade-off between computational complexity and performance remains one of the critical chal- lenges. The proposed method in this study builds on these foundations by introducing novel weighting strategies tailored to overcome some of these challenges. 3 Proposed Method Methods of block matching are used for motion prediction. In block matching, blocks are compared for similarity or dissimilarity in a search ﬁeld speciﬁed in a prior frame. In the determined scanning area, the block candidates that are most similar to the target block are determined. Since one should expect that, with the usage of multiple reference blocks per target block, the difference between target and predicted blocks will be smaller, and the errors for the multi and single block methods are comparable at this level, without the employment of the transform-coding. In fact, smaller amounts of residues result in lesser number of coded bits. However, we ignored that gain and focused on PSNR gain in the ﬁnal picture.

It is expected that this weight would always be larger than the others since it is the weight of the most similar block. In the experiments, we have chosen this value to be ﬁxed at 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 or 1.0 and allowed others to vary. To show the proof of concept, we also limited n to be 1, 2 or 3 in the experiments. This approach also helps reduce the amount of information to be sent to the decoder. On the other hand, one should expect a slight degradation in PSNR compared to the all-free weights case (where all weights are calculated). To further reduce the data to be coded for the decoder, weight sets are created. Instead of completely letting the remaining weights be free (ﬂoating point real values), the sets are designed to be addressed by 3 and 5 bit indexes corresponding to weights in sets of 8 and 32 weights. Experimental results for the limited set approach are also given in the following section along with the unlimited weight case. The sets are pre-calculated statistically using the clustering/quantization method. 4 Experimental Results The experiments were conducted in the MA TLAB environment to overcome the com- plexity of reference software provided by the standards.

One also expects that for smaller and less number of quantized output (meaning lesser number of bits) from Tr-Q pair, input to the Tr stage should be formed of smaller numbers. That is, smaller the difference values applied to Tr Use of Multiple Reference Blocks for Reconstruction in Video Coding 623 stage, higher the compression ratio.

As expected, PSNR values for the weight sets are higher than the single reference case but slightly lower than the “all-free weights” for both 2 and 3 reference block cases. 5 Conclusion With increasing computation power in video end-points, we have experimentally eval- uated the possibility of increasing the video quality at some cost in complexity. New standards (HEVC) aim to achieve this mainly with larger/variable block sizes, in which the transform sizes can be increased, resulting in a more efﬁcient (lesser loss) quanti- zation step. However, we have experimentally shown that, the use of multiple weighted reference blocks also improves the video quality considerably. Unlike other multi-reference approaches in this ﬁeld, the proposed method uniquely integrates the least squares technique with novel weighting approaches, enhancing its efﬁciency and adaptability. It improves the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by an average of 1.5 dB, at the expense of an increase of 3–5 bits per block. This trade-off is acceptable even within basic MPEG compression schemes, and the method can be easily adapted to both older and newer MPEG algorithms and software.

Cloud computing has revolutionized data storage and processing, but it faces signiﬁcant security challenges, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and lack of transparency. The advances made in the ﬁeld of technology have changed how data are stored, processed, and even accessed: there is no longer a need to rely on physical tools like a computer. However, there is signiﬁcant oppo- sition when it comes to performing processes in the cloud such as data breaches, lack of authorization, or lack of transparency. These inverted features become impediments in the cloud environment, and a comprehensive approach is required to improve it. This stems from a reliance on older approaches, where matters are dealt with on a singular basis. Without cooperative effort, cloud protection strategies will continue using lower-level tools that lack depth. This would make augmenting the central point of a cloud primitive in nature and its features useless.

It offers on-demand services and distant infrastructure have shifted the expenditures companies spent upholding large amounts of physical servers [ 1]. These servers aren’t necessary, allowing companies to reduce their expenses while improving their efﬁciency greatly. Now, businesses can scale their processes without worrying about degenerative resources. These cloud ser- vices can be further broken down into Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) based on the supplies of the busi- ness [ 2]. That being said, cloud computing does have its disadvantages in the form of security. The model is prone to data breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance glitches. The more traditional methods of using cloud systems rely on the centraliza- tion of data which makes them vulnerable to loss of data and cyberattacks.

With the cumulative reliance on cloud services, the security of the cloud has arisen as one of the supreme challenges. Because of these annals, which include ﬁnancial data, personal details, and even business intellect, the cloud serves as a haven for cybercriminals. There are insiders, for example, who can misappropriate their access and freedoms to perform data manipulation while other dishonest personnel can launch DoS attacks against the business. Such gaps in security measures point towards the need for robust multilayer security provisions. Also, regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or ISO 27001, provide well established data protection rules and are known for their ﬁrm demand on the greatest scrutiny of data handling processes. Although systems and applications commerce with cloud security offer remote control management, the majority of traditional cloud secu- rity approaches, to some degree, offer misleading solace from dangerous data operation attempts. Therefore, the framework for trust, security, and data protection has to house the continuously developing cloud landscape [ 4].

Blocks on a blockchain are formed in a sequential manner where every block builds upon the previous one. Blocks are, however, further categorized into parts. Each block incorporates three primary parts: data information, the cryptographic hash of the block, and the cryptographic hash of the prior block which was hashed previously. This process is known as hashing. Each block is connected by a link that makes alter- ations impossible. Each block in the blockchain is reliant on a previous block. Once a block is created, it cannot be moved or altered. Once a transaction takes place, it gets approved and moves to the next stage which can be heritage, parent, or anything else. Blockchain uses PoW or PoS consensus algorithms. The hardened block elimination process yields an alteration hash that would alert the system to such malicious changes. Sensitive cyber information is highly protected from manipulations, fraud, and threats, see Fig. 1 [1]. Blockchain can be categorized into four main types based on access control and participation mechanisms:  Public Blockchain: This is a completely open network that anybody can join. They can also authenticate transactions as well as take part in the agreement. Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum public wallets have comprehensive security and trans- parency, however, the inspection of transactions (mining) does cause problems with scalability along with energy use [ 7]."

Organizations employ Private Blockchains for internal operations and need some level of safety and efﬁciency like supply chain groups and enterprise solutions. These blockchains have better performance and privacy but do not enable decentralization.  Hybrid Blockchain: This is a middle ground between public and private blockchains, allowing some level of access control over the data [ 8]. In a hybrid blockchain, while some info is kept undisclosed, some data is made available to the public. This model can cater to the needs of industries that require conﬁdentiality while maintaining some level of transparency.  Consortium Blockchain: This refers to a semi-decentralized blockchain which is run by a group of organizations and not a single entity. Blockchains of this kind are case-speciﬁc to collaboration settings such as those in the academic, banking, or governmental data sharing sectors where trust is widespread across multiple parties [ 8]. 632 A.

On the other hand, the body contains valid transactions that have already been conﬁrmed and are accepted by the network as shown in Fig. 2. 2.1 Primary Information The primary information kept in a block relies on the particular use case of the blockchain. Each block has records of transactions or data entries relative to the proper use case. For instance, in ﬁnancial systems, it might keep transaction information such as the sender, receiver and the amount. In supply chain management, some block may have the shipment details with timestamps. In the healthcare’s case, blockchain can maintain patient’s records with a high level of security, marked by immutability and conﬁdentiality. That ﬂexibility mark is the reason blockchain can be adopted by various other industries with security and sufﬁciency to data integrity, and safety from breaches [ 9]. 2.2 Hash A hash is a set of data with a secure length and serves as a sole cryptographic ﬁngerprint allocated to each block in the chain, where only one exact hash can be used for a single block. The SHA-256, for example, is the hashing algorithm used for Bitcoin. The hash serves as a secure identiﬁer and assures integrity of data inside the block [ 10].

The blockchain uses a Merkle tree validation system to validate transactions in an efﬁcient way. A Merkle tree whose leaves are transactions is a Transaction Merkle Tree [11]. Then these hashes are chained together and hashed repeatedly until one single root hash is produced and stored in the block header. This technique simpliﬁes data veriﬁcation and reduces the need for storage, since only the root hash must be stored and checked on all nodes. Fig. 2. Blockchain Block Structure (Blockchain Structure and Components) 2.3 Timestamp Each block bears a header that contains the hash of the preceding block, its own hash, and the metadata from the transaction: the previous block’s hash and the block itself. Each block is said to have a Block Height, after a call sign indicates its upper limit, meaning 634 A. Sharma et al. that the block contains 500 transactions. A transaction is known to have a weight of about 250 bytes of data. The block header, on the other hand, is observed to be very lightweight and only weighs 80 bytes (shown in Table 1). The blockchain system makes use of a distributed consensus mechanism to validate transactions and secure the network.

This has the potential to incur great downtimes, ﬁnancial costs, and data loss. The employment of replicated data in cold storage across various regions can reduce these risks [ 13]. 3.2 Identity and Access Management Issues Identity and user access control resources in cloud security are a very big problem challenge in the cloud. Weak authentication mechanisms, poor privilege control, and credential corruption are very likely to result in sensitive data being revealed without consent. Phishing attacks and credential stealing can be very powerful against common methods of authentication, which are, to say passwords. To improve identity and access management security, implementing multi factor authentication, zero-trust models, and role-based access control must be adopted. 3.3 Compliance and Regulatory Challenges Governments that rely on cloud services will have to comply with a number of legal frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001. However, compliance becomes com- plex when data is kept in different locations, as different countries have varying data protection laws.

Distributed identity management, cryptographic data, and unalterable audit trails to protect data through blockchain technology could help enhance cloud security [ 14]. 4 Blockchain for Cloud Security Cloud computing or cloud computing continues to grow, complementing other modern digital networks which have already been established. Broadly speaking, cloud com- puting has supplanted the traditional digital infrastructure of services. Concerns over security at the business level are still a signiﬁcant issue, especially when dealing with sensitive information. A decentralized blockchain mechanism encompasses the entire company and encrypts all the units associated with the cloud, thus rendering the infras- tructure climate more secure in an additional layer. While the unique capabilities of blockchain can be useful to the organization, traditional cloud security approaches are ineffective because their risks are inevitably accepted as shown in Table 2 [15, 16]. 636 A.

Subsequently, no single entity will have the power to alter the information without the permission of the relevant authorities. The irony lies in blockchain’s capacity to prove security without facing the threat of a monolithic service provider, unlike current cloud security approaches which rely on issued contracts between the provider and the consumers. Conversely, the incorporation of blockchain in cloud protection facilities enables enterprises to obtain maximum resiliency and endurance to operational cloud security failure within one framework [ 6]. The core advantages of blockchain in cloud security include:  Tamper-Resistant Data Storage: Once data is recorded on a blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring integrity.  Decentralized Authentication: Eliminates the need for centralized identity manage- ment, reducing risks associated with credential theft.  Enhanced Access Control: Smart contracts automate permissions, ensuring only authorized users can access critical data.  Auditability and Transparency: All transactions are logged, providing full traceability for compliance and monitoring. 4.2 Key Features of Blockchain in Cloud Security Blockchain’s effectiveness in securing cloud environments is primarily driven by the following key characteristics:  Decentralization: A cloud service provider having a private data center is a single"

With blockchain, data is stored in multiple nodes, so if one node is compromised, the rest are still secured, and the system will still be functional.  Immutability: A blockchain transaction is stored in an order of blocks secured using hash functions. Before adding a new block to a previous one, altering earlier blocks requires a consensus from all nodes in the network, which prevents unauthorized changes, making it highly secure.  Transparency: Blockchain eliminates the need for trust among different parties since the blockchain’s ledger is public, and everyone can verify their transactions, which increases credibility of cloud providers and ensures regulations are followed [ 17]. 4.3 Comparative Analysis: Traditional Security vs. Blockchain-Based Security Comparison between traditional security and blockchain-based security: The conven- tional method of securing the cloud uses central control systems like passwords, ﬁrewalls, and permissions. These solutions usually have security loopholes like data theft, inter- nal espionage, and lack of clarity. But with blockchain, the adoption of decentralized security models can signiﬁcantly improve security robustness.

Blockchain offers improved security through tamper-proof ledgers that ensure all sen- sitive transactions are safely stored. Unauthorized access is signiﬁcantly reduced with the aid of smart contracts that make spending, transferring, or even signing contracts completely automated, which minimizes operational threats. 7.2 Securing Healthcare Data in the Cloud There are ongoing challenges related to privacy, accuracy, and compliance on all levels in the healthcare sector. Basic cloud storage of sensitive medical data poses the risk of being leaked or altered without permission. Storing records through blockchain adoption mitigates these issues since records will be encrypted and accessible only to approved persons. In addition, smart contracts can also simplify compliant access control for regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. This technology does not compromise conﬁdentiality and security while improving interoperability among providers in the healthcare system [ 9, 20]. 7.3 Blockchain for Secure IoT Cloud Networks As the world embraces the IoT world, the need to protect the cloud infrastructure of IoT devices is a major concern.

Blockchain improves the security of IoT networks by replacing the single point of failure with decentralized authentication methods. Every interaction of IoT devices is stored on a blockchain so that it can never be altered, ensuring absolute protection from tampering. In addition, consensus mechanisms increase trust between devices and decrease exposure to malicious attacks. 7.4 Decentralized Storage Solutions (IPFS, Filecoin, Storj) Directly storing ﬁles on the cloud usually needs the assistance of a centralized provider, which holds the potential to compromise sensitive data or lead to tampering, deletion, or rendering data inaccessible altogether. Cloud storage providers such as Interplane- tary File System (IPFS), Filecoin, and Storj use blockchain technologies to back up and restore data from designated points. This makes IPFS, Filecoin, and Storj stronger than ordinary cloud services since single entity dependency is wiped out. Cryptogra- phy is implemented to protect ﬁles, guaranteeing that data will always be accessible and secured [ 21]. Among the many distinctions between decentralized and centralized storage methods, the most important is that decentralized ﬁle storage is automatically protected against unwanted intrusion, making it far ahead of other backup solutions in terms of practicality and superior reliability in volatile environments [ 6].

Enhancing Cloud Computing Security with Blockchain 643 8 Challenges and Future Directions Cloud security is positively affected with the aid of blockchain technology. Even though the use of blockchain technology has major beneﬁts for cloud security, there are still important concerns that should be dealt with to guarantee effectiveness and adoption on a larger scale. There are problems such as issues of scalability, excessive energy usage, regulatory issues, and the constant attempt at innovation to improve the security aspect of the cloud with blockchain solutions. 8.1 Scalability Issues in Blockchain-Based Cloud Security As with any other implementation of blockchain technology, scalability remains one of the most important challenges, especially with public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The challenge in achieving adequate integration between blockchain and cloud security is efﬁcient scaling. The consensus mechanisms utilized for public blockchains, like Proof of Work (PoW), lead to slow transaction processing for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Consequently, for cloud computing systems needing faster processing and data storage, blockchains must enhance their transaction throughput for effective large- scale operations [ 22]. While layer-two scaling solutions utilizing sidechains and sharding have the potential to resolve these issues, their application within cloud infrastructure has yet to be developed further."

PoW blockchain networks provide security but require high energy usage. Major environmental effects such as high electricity consumption are a signiﬁcant drawback. While Proof of Stake (PoS) models offer improved efﬁciency, they still require energy resources, although signiﬁcantly lower than PoW. Renewable energy alternatives such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) offer viable solutions. To move towards sustain- able blockchain-based security solutions, transitioning to PoS models can help save the environment and utilize cloud-based secure computing alternatives. 8.3 Regulatory and Compliance Challenges The compliance issues are related to governance structures that stem from decentralized information storage.

However, this increased connectivity introduces a signiﬁcant vulnerability: an expanded attack surface ripe for sophisticated cyber-physical threats. The ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline in May 2021 [ 1], which disrupted fuel distribution across the U.S. East Coast and incurred recovery costs exceeding $4.4 million, serves as a stark reminder of the critical necessity for robust Network Intrusion Detection Systems speciﬁcally designed for IIoT environments. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026 K.

These challenges include: • Massive Data V olumes: IIoT networks can generate terabytes of trafﬁc daily, overwhelming conventional intrusion detection systems [ 2]. • Extreme Class Imbalance: Anomalies, such as cyberattacks, constitute an extremely small fraction (often less than 0.01%) of the total network trafﬁc, leading models to prioritize the majority class (normal trafﬁc) and exhibit poor anomaly detection performance [ 3]. • Computational Constraints: The edge devices and cloud-based notebook environ- ments commonly used in IIoT deployments (like Kaggle notebooks with limited RAM and GPU resources) lack the computational power required to train complex models on entire, massive datasets. Deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, show promise in analyzing sequential data like network ﬂows and identifying temporal patterns indicative of anomalies [ 4]. Nevertheless, their inherent “black-box” nature makes it difﬁcult to understand their decisions, and they often suffer from poor precision when faced with extreme class imbalance [ 5]. Our initial experiments with an LSTM model on the CICADA-IIoT2024 dataset highlighted this issue, achieving an 88% recall rate but a mere 0.9% precision. This translates to an overwhelming 1,805 false alarms for every 80 true anomalies detected.

While effective in learning compressed representations, AEs often suffer from a high rate of false positives, particularly when dealing with the signiﬁcant class imbalance characteristic of IIoT data. • Hybrid Models: Architectures combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and LSTMs, such as those in [ 10], aim to capture both spatial and temporal features in network trafﬁc. While potentially powerful, these models typically incur substantially higher training costs, with studies like [ 11] showing increases of up to 40% compared to standalone LSTMs. This computational overhead can be a major barrier in resource- constrained IIoT environments. • Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Emerging approaches like those in [ 12] represent network topology as graphs and apply GNNs to model relationships and detect anoma- lies based on structural and behavioral patterns. However, GNNs can face challenges in dynamic IIoT environments where network conﬁgurations and connections change frequently. LSTMs, as used in our study, are particularly adept at capturing sequential dependencies within network ﬂows, such as the timing and order of packets [ 13]. Despite this strength, their performance signiﬁcantly degrades in terms of precision when faced with extreme class imbalance, as clearly demonstrated by the low precision observed in our initial baseline model."

Ahmad 2.2 Class Imbalance Mitigation Addressing the severe class imbalance in IIoT datasets is crucial for developing effective NIDS. Two primary strategies are commonly employed: • Data-Level Methods: Techniques like Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) [ 14] aim to balance the dataset by generating synthetic samples for the minority class. While effective for smaller datasets, SMOTE faces signiﬁcant scal- ability issues when applied to massive datasets exceeding 10 million records, often leading to memory overﬂow, as encountered in our own trials at 8.6 million samples [ 15]. • Algorithm-Level Methods: These methods adjust the learning algorithm to be more sensitive to the minority class. • Cost-Sensitive Learning: Assigning higher misclassiﬁcation costs to the minority class during training, as explored in [ 16], can boost recall but frequently results in an increase in false positives. • Threshold Adjustment: This post-hoc technique, discussed in [17], involves tuning the classiﬁcation threshold of a trained model to optimize the precision-recall trade-off. This approach is computationally efﬁcient and particularly relevant for deployment in resource-limited environments, yet its potential in the speciﬁc context of IIoT anomaly detection remains relatively underexplored. 2.3 XAI in Cybersecurity Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) [ 18]"

SHAP is a game theory-based approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It calculates the contribution of each feature to the prediction for an instance by considering all possible combinations of features. LIME is a technique that explains the predictions of any classiﬁer or regressor by approximating it locally with an interpretable model. It explains individual predictions by learning an interpretable model around the prediction. In the cybersecurity domain, XAI is often used for post-hoc interpretation of model predictions, for instance, in understanding why a particular network ﬂow was ﬂagged as malicious. Studies like [ 20], which applied XAI to IoT device ﬁngerprinting, are representative of this post-hoc application. However, there is a notable gap in research that utilizes XAI not just for explanation after the fact, but for actively and iteratively reﬁning models to improve their perfor- mance.

This assumption limits their applica- bility in resource-constrained edge devices and cloud-based notebook environments. Our research develops a workﬂow speciﬁcally designed for such limitations. • Actionable XAI: While XAI is increasingly used for model interpretation in cyber- security, few studies demonstrate a clear link between the explanations provided by XAI techniques and subsequent, tangible adjustments to the model itself, such as feature removal or architectural changes. We explicitly utilize XAI outputs to guide feature engineering and model simpliﬁcation. • Precision-Focused Tuning: The majority of research in IIoT NIDS tends to prioritize maximizing recall to minimize missed anomalies [ 23].

Fig. 1. Research Methodology 3.1 Dataset and Environment For this study, we utilized the CICADA-IIoT2024 dataset, which is divided into Phase 1 (12M records) and Phase 2 (9.5M records), totaling 21.6 million records. The dataset 652 W. Ahmad comprises 70 features capturing various aspects of network trafﬁc, including ﬂow statis- tics, protocol ﬂags, and temporal metrics. All experiments were conducted within Kag- gle notebooks, which provide a representative resource-constrained environment with 4 CPU cores, 30 GB RAM, and a T4 GPU with 16 GB RAM. 3.2 Data Pre-processing Handling the massive scale of the CICADA-IIoT2024 dataset within the available resources required careful pre-processing steps focused on memory optimization and managing class imbalance. • Memory Optimization: To reduce the memory footprint of the dataset, we applied column-type downcasting, converting data types like ﬂoat64 to ﬂoat32 where appro- priate.

Data normalization was performed to scale features to a similar range, which is important for the performance of deep learning models. • Handling Class Imbalance and Sampling: Given the extreme class imbalance (approx- imately 1 anomaly for every 21,000 normal samples in the sampled data) and the dataset size, traditional oversampling methods like SMOTE were not feasible due to memory limitations. To manage the data volume for model training while retaining the original class distribution, we took a 40% random sample of the combined dataset. This sampling strategy allowed us to train the model under resource constraints, albeit at the cost of potentially losing some of the ﬁne-grained temporal continuity present in the full dataset. 3.3 Implications and Limitations of Sampling Implications: • Feasibility in Resource-Constrained Environments: Sampling allowed us to handle and process a massive dataset that would otherwise be unmanageable with lim- ited computational resources. This demonstrates a practical approach for developing models when high-performance computing clusters are not available. • Retention of Original Class Distribution: The random sampling strategy aimed to maintain the original class distribution of the data.

Limitations: • Potential for Sampling Bias: We acknowledge that using a random sample might introduce some bias. This means the sample may not perfectly represent the entire dataset. • Loss of Temporal Continuity and Rare Patterns: A signiﬁcant limitation is that sam- pling could lead to the loss of some ﬁne-grained temporal continuity present in the full dataset. Furthermore, rare and complex attack patterns might not be fully cap- tured in the sample, potentially affecting the model’s ability to detect them. Future work suggests exploring alternative data handling techniques to better preserve these aspects.

Baseline LSTM: The initial LSTM model architecture was deﬁned as follows: Sequential([ Input(shape=(1, 63)), LSTM(64, return_sequences=True), Dropout(0.2), LSTM(32), Dropout(0.2), Dense(32, activation='relu'), Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') ]) The input shape of (1, 63) for the baseline LSTM model signiﬁes the structure of the data being fed into the model for each instance:"

For this LSTM model, each input instance is treated as a sequence of length one. • 63: This dimension represents the number of features used to describe each data point in the input sequence. The original CICADA-IIoT2024 dataset contained 70 features. After initial pre-processing but before XAI-guided feature engineering, the model was trained on these 63 features. Following XAI-guided feature removal, the ﬁnal model used 58 features. • Final Model: Based on our iterative reﬁnement process guided by XAI, the ﬁnal model architecture was simpliﬁed to reduce overﬁtting and improve generalization. This involved using smaller LSTM layers (e.g., LSTM(32)) and increasing the dropout rate to 0.3. We also incorporated early stopping with a patience of 3 to halt training when the validation loss stopped, this has participated in improving and preventing the model from overﬁtting to the training data. 3.6 XAI-Guided Feature Engineering To understand the model’s behavior and guide feature engineering, we employed SHAP and LIME, chosen for their respective strengths in providing both global and local inter- pretability.

Table 3 presents the performance metrics at various classiﬁcation thresholds. Key observations from the threshold tuning results are: • Trade-off Behavior: As expected, there is a clear trade-off between precision and recall as the classiﬁcation threshold is varied. Precision dramatically improves from 0.035 to 0.55 as the threshold increases from 0.5 to 0.9995. Conversely, recall declines from 0.825 to 0.412 over the same range. • F1-Score Peak: The F1-score, which provides a balance between precision and recall, peaks at 0.515 when the threshold is set to 0.9993. At this threshold, the model achieves a precision of 0.506 and a recall of 0.525. Improving IIoT Anomaly Detection Precision 657 Table 3.

This yields a precision of 0.55 and only 27 false positives, but it comes at the cost of a lower recall (0.412) and a higher number of missed threats. • A balanced approach, considering both minimizing missed anomalies and reducing false alarms, is achieved at the F1-score maximizing threshold of 0.9993.

By analyzing the impact of individual features on misclassiﬁcations, we were able to identify counterintuitive relationships, such as certain features unex- pectedly contributing to false positives or false negatives. This allowed us to make targeted adjustments to the feature set, leading to a more robust model. For instance, the removal of features like Radius and Covariance, which were identiﬁed by XAI as negatively impacting precision in false negative cases, directly contributed to the improved performance of the ﬁnal model. 2. The Necessity of Threshold Tuning in Imbalanced Contexts: Our ﬁndings underscore that using a default classiﬁcation threshold of 0.5 is highly ineffective in the presence of extreme class imbalance. The initial precision of 3.5% at this threshold, even after feature engineering, is impractically low for real-world SOC operations. Through careful threshold tuning, we were able to increase the precision fourteen-fold (to 50.6% at the F1-maximizing threshold), demonstrating that threshold adjustment is a crucial step in optimizing model performance for the speciﬁc requirements of anomaly detection in imbalanced datasets. The choice of threshold allows organizations to tailor the NIDS to their speciﬁc risk tolerance and operational capacity, prioritizing either the detection of as many anomalies as possible or minimizing the number of false alarms requiring investigation.

Signiﬁcant Reduction in False Positives: The 97% reduction in false positives com- pared to the baseline is a major achievement of this study. This drastic decrease makes the NIDS signiﬁcantly more practical for deployment in IIoT environments where SOCs cannot handle thousands of false alerts daily. By reducing the noise from false alarms, security analysts can focus their efforts on investigating a much smaller and more relevant set of potential threats, improving the overall efﬁciency and effectiveness of security operations. 4. Feasibility in Resource-Constrained Environments: Our work demonstrates that it is possible to build and train effective deep learning models for IIoT anomaly detec- tion even within the limitations of resource-constrained environments like Kaggle notebooks. The memory optimization techniques employed in our data processing pipeline were essential for handling the large-scale dataset, and the simpliﬁed LSTM architecture, guided by XAI, proved to be computationally feasible while achieving good performance. This is particularly relevant for IIoT deployments where edge devices often have limited processing power and memory. 4.4 Limitations Despite the promising results, our study has certain limitations that warrant consideration for future work: • Sampling Bias: The use of a 40% random sample of the dataset, while necessary for training within resource constraints, might introduce some bias and potentially fail"

Further work is needed to explore methods for further increasing precision while maintaining acceptable recall. 5 Conclusion and Future Work This study successfully demonstrates that integrating Explainable AI techniques, specif- ically SHAP and LIME, into the feature engineering and model tuning process signif- icantly enhances the precision of LSTM-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems for Industrial Internet of Things environments. By effectively utilizing XAI to identify and remove detrimental features and by carefully tuning the classiﬁcation threshold, we achieved a substantial 97% reduction in false positives compared to our baseline model.

While traditional encryption focuses on securing data through obfuscation, steganography aims for imperceptibility, making the very presence of hidden data difﬁ- cult to detect [ 2]. This inherent stealth poses a signiﬁcant challenge to digital forensic investigators, who are tasked with uncovering hidden evidence in a landscape increas- ingly saturated with digital media [ 3]. Current steganographic analysis, or steganalysis, tools often exhibit limitations in their scope, relying on single-algorithm approaches or lacking robust adaptability to diverse steganographic techniques and media types [ 4, 5]. Moreover, the sheer volume and complexity of digital data necessitate automated and intelligent systems that can sift through noise and pinpoint subtle anomalies indicative of hidden content [ 6].

Prior work has often focused on optimizing single steganographic detection algorithms [ 7] or applying generic machine learning models to speciﬁc steganographic methods [8]. However, a uniﬁed framework that leverages the strengths of multiple statistical and algorithmic detection techniques—such as F5 anal- ysis and Least Signiﬁcant Bit (LSB) analysis—and then reﬁnes their outputs through the predictive power of machine learning, speciﬁcally Support V ector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), remains largely unexplored in its full poten- tial for real-world forensic applications [ 9, 10]. This synthesis is particularly crucial as cybercriminals increasingly employ hybrid steganographic schemes to evade detec- tion, blurring the lines between different embedding techniques. Our contribution to this identiﬁed gap is multifaceted. Firstly, we introduce the StegAnalysis Suite, an innovative application that meticulously integrates F5 and LSB analysis with Chi-Square statistical methods, creating a synergistic algorithmic foundation for detecting hidden data in both JPEG and PNG images, as well as MP3 audio ﬁles [ 11, 12]. This fusion allows for a more comprehensive assessment of digital media, addressing the limitations of single-method approaches. Secondly, and critically, the suite leverages advanced machine learning algo- rithms—SVM for its robust classiﬁcation capabilities and CNN for its efﬁcacy in feature extraction from raw data—to intelligently process the outputs of these statistical analy- ses ["

A thorough systematic literature review reveals a foundational challenge: the inherent difﬁculty in distinguishing subtle modiﬁcations introduced by steganographic embed- ding from innocent, inherent noise within digital media [ 21]. Many existing steganal- ysis methods, while effective in controlled environments, often falter when confronted with real-world complexities, such as diverse steganographic algorithms, varying media formats, and the adaptive nature of steganographers [ 22]. Prior research has extensively explored individual facets of steganalysis. For instance, statistical approaches, like Chi-Square analysis, have demonstrated utility in detecting speciﬁc patterns of LSB embedding, particularly in uncompressed images [ 23]. Simi- larly, algorithms tailored for JPEG images, such as F5 analysis, focus on quantifying changes in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefﬁcients, proving effective against cer- tain forms of embedding [24]. However, the efﬁcacy of these methods is often conﬁned to speciﬁc steganographic techniques or media types, lacking the universality required for"

However, the efﬁcacy of these methods is often conﬁned to speciﬁc steganographic techniques or media types, lacking the universality required for comprehensive cybercrime investigations. The reliance on single-point detection mecha- nisms creates critical vulnerabilities, as cybercriminals can simply switch steganographic algorithms or media types to evade detection. The integration of machine learning into steganalysis has indeed shown promise, with studies leveraging SVMs for classifying stego-images based on extracted features [ 9] and CNNs for directly learning intricate patterns from raw pixel data or DCT coefﬁcients [1]. These advanced machine learning algorithms have been applied to various domains, from credit card fraud detection to healthcare diagnostics, showcasing their robust clas- siﬁcation capabilities. However, a signiﬁcant empirical gap persists in the systematic combination of these distinct strengths. While some research explores the application of machine learning to steganography [ 25], few studies thoroughly investigate the syn- ergistic interplay between classical statistical steganalysis techniques and cutting-edge machine learning models in a uniﬁed, multi-media platform. Existing approaches often treat feature extraction and classiﬁcation as separate, sequential steps, overlooking the potential for a feedback mechanism or concurrent analysis that could enhance overall detection efﬁcacy.

Furthermore, a critical functional gap lies in the development of forensic tools that not only detect steganography but also provide comprehensive reporting and user-friendly interfaces. Many academic prototypes, while theoretically sound, lack the practical usability and integration necessary for adoption by digital forensic practitioners. The absence of robust, integrated solutions compels investigators to rely on a patchwork of tools, leading to inefﬁciencies and potential oversight of crucial evidence. The notion 666 J. Mardodaj and B.

This study empirically addresses these identiﬁed gaps by constructing and validating the StegAnalysis Suite. We aim to provide a robust solution that transcends the limita- tions of isolated techniques by combining two powerful paradigms: (1) an ensemble of established statistical and algorithmic steganalysis methods (F5, LSB, Chi-Square) for initial artifact identiﬁcation, and (2) advanced machine learning models (SVM, CNN) for intelligent classiﬁcation and reﬁnement of these detections.

BOSSbase 1.01 Dataset (Images): This dataset comprises 10,000 grayscale images, which are widely used in steganalysis research for their high quality and diversity. Researchers can access this dataset at: http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/BOS Sbase.html.  Data Collection Process: The dataset itself provides clean cover images. To gen- erate stego-images, we randomly selected 5,000 images from BOSSbase 1.01 and embedded various payloads using standard steganographic tools implementing F5, LSB, and JPEG steganography algorithms (e.g., StegHide, F5 implementa- tion). The embedding rates varied from 0.05 bpp (bits per pixel) to 0.4 bpp to simulate different levels of stealth. The remaining 5,000 images served as pristine cover images. This created a balanced dataset of 5,000 stego-images and 5,000 cover-images. For embedding steganographic content, the study employed well- established tools to maintain consistency and replicability. Speciﬁcally, the F5 steganography was implemented using the standard Java-based JP Hide & Seek tool, version 4.3, which applies F5 matrix encoding with conﬁgurable embedding strength.

Frequent utilization of online trans- actions, cloud apps, and remote approval has created the need for strong identity conﬁr- mation systems [ 6]. The central database commonly used for traditional identiﬁcation administration remains exposed to data infringement, unlawful access, and cyberattacks.

Give additional stimulus in security scenarios [ 7]. 2 Context and Associated Research Current identiﬁcation management solutions maintain user identities in a centralized database; however, this approach leaves these credentials vulnerable to intrusions and unauthorized access (Table 1). Decentralized Identiﬁers (DIDS) and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), two features of blockchain technology, provide users with complete con- trol over their personal data [ 6]. The primary advantages of this strategy, according to research on blockchain-based identity systems, are improved user privacy, reduced fraud, and enhanced security. For the public to use the blockchain identity system, interoperability, regulatory compliance issues must be resolved [ 1]. 2.1 Conventional Approaches for Managing Identities Their identity, primarily that of users, is certiﬁed and veriﬁed by the traditional work- place in charge of identiﬁcation management systems [ 9].

By giving any third entity without authorization the ability to make deci- sions about data collection, technology users restrict their own control over their personal information [12]. 2.2 Using Blockchain Technology for Identity Management Identiﬁcation management is decentralized by blockchain technology, rendering cen- tral authorities unnecessary. For further security measures, each piece of identifying information kept in blockchain blocks can be validated to stay irreversible [ 18]. By transparently conﬁrming every transaction, blockchain contributes to the development of trust and makes it possible to prevent fraud by providing safe security against unwanted access [ 15].

Before selecting service providers to obtain speciﬁc data, users can securely save their identity on blockchain-based DIDs. SSI gives consumers the ability to control their personal data, reducing the possibility of unauthorized data gathering and exploitation [ 2]. 2.3 Smart Contract Language for Identiﬁcation V eriﬁcation When pre-coded certiﬁcation methods are executed, the identity conﬁrmation system operates independently via smart contracts. Blockchain entries and user-generated data are analyzed to compare smart contracts and determine whether they are accepted or denied [ 5]. These technologies eliminate the need for human involvement in veriﬁca- tion, which speeds up certiﬁcation procedures and reduces the risk of human handling accidents. 2.4 Explanation of Blockchain-Based Identity V eriﬁcation Flow (Fig. 1) Figure 1 illustrates a secure, decentralized identity veriﬁcation process facilitated by smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs on a blockchain platform.

If invalid, the request is denied instantly, thereby only allowing registered and trusted DIDs to be processed. – Retrieve and V erify Credentials: After verifying a valid DID, related identity credentials are retrieved and veriﬁed to ensure authenticity. – Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation and V alidation: In order to maximize privacy, a Zero-Knowledge Proof is generated. This enables the user to prove credential own- ership without disclosing actual data.

Due to their inadequate storage and transaction processing capabilities, public blocks are limited in their ability to serve large populations. Interoperability is an issue, since many blockchain systems adhere to distinct protocols, which restricts the creation of a single universal identity veriﬁcation procedure [ 18]. Although blockchain retains its irreversible nature, GDPR, when combined with other regulations, imposes obligations to remove and amend data [ 11]. Transferring to decentralized individuals with concentrated identiﬁcation systems must be challenging for organizations because they lack the requisite expertise and experience to manage inadequate infrastructure [4]. 3 Techniques This research employs a mixed-methods methodology to determine the potential of blockchain technology for cloud identiﬁcation management.

Off-Chain Storage: With security expenses and scalability issues that affect all identi- ﬁcation data on the Bitcoin blockchain, the openness blockchain becomes out of propor- tion. In order to prevent needless blockchain storage expenses, off-chain storage should be utilized through the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) with other non-essential iden- tiﬁcation attributes [ 16]. Blockchain has only the essential metadata and cryptographic elements. The off-blockchain storing approach avoids costly storage costs for functioning on the chance while safeguarding data integrity [ 6]. 4.3 Interoperability Layer The interoperability layer is an interface that is compatible with the existing certiﬁcation treatment and supplier identiﬁcation methods.

Because cloud computing can accommodate more users, it can help the Blockchain Identiﬁcation Management System scale more efﬁciently [ 4]. The cloud-based identity veriﬁcation solution offered by microservices consequently improves system response and lowers latency. 5 Risk to Security 5.1 Scalability When working on a big scale, the performance of blockchain technology limits the chal- lenge of handling enormous amounts of identity data. They are not qualiﬁed to verify the real-time identiﬁcation because their current models only handle a very modest trans- action pace of a few transactions per second [ 8].

A one-to-one function produces outputs that determine their values since the same input produces the same results. When employing this cryptographic technique, medical practitioners think it is nearly hard to recover the original input [ 11]. 7.2 Mathematical Representation The following equation can be used by users to establish the entry. H = SHA256(ID) w here: H is the hash value of the identity data. ID stands for digital identity information. SHA256() is a 256-bit function that represents the secure hash algorithm [ 13]. “JohnDOE, 01-01-1990, ID: 123456” is transformed into the irreversible unique value “e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb924” through the hashing of user identiﬁcation using SHA-256. “JohnDOE, 01-01-1990, ID: 123456” = e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb924 is the result of SHA256, depicted in Fig. 4. Hashing functions play a major role in identity management due to two key beneﬁts over alternative techniques.

To protect privacy through security mechanisms, a blockchain stores the hash rather than personal information.

SHA-256 Hashing Function for Identity Data 7.3 V erifying with Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Zero-knowledge proof, or ZKP , is the procedure by which people demonstrate speciﬁc facts to others without actually giving them access to the information they are conﬁrming. ZKPs allow users to substantiate claims while completely hiding any personal informa- tion from the party doing the veriﬁcation as shown in Fig. 5. By employing this method- ology to demonstrate verbalized truth statements, the prover preserves informational conﬁdentiality regarding their knowing methods [ 14]. A mathematical representation is V (x) P → (x) (1) The veriﬁer’s role V(x) analyzes the proofs put forward by P(x). The prover generates P(x) as a proof using conﬁdential identiﬁable information. x = Private information (such a user’s b irthdate) The algorithm establishes that a person is at least eighteen years old without requesting their birth date.

People can conﬁrm attributes like age or nationality by using veriﬁcation procedures that prevent users from disclosing personal information. Blockchain processes allow users to complete authentication without the need for a central authority. Identity theft is less likely because the system doesn’t exchange any real personal information [17]. 8 Findings and Conversations The following are the primary ﬁndings from the Blockchain identiﬁcation management system’s outcome analysis: 8.1 Safety A decentralized system greatly reduces the likelihood of identity theft and illegal access. Since the detecting registries will not be able to access the blockchain warranty, fraud will be reduced [ 18]. Harnessing Cloud-Based Blockchain Technology 685 Fig. 5.

However, the transaction is still coerced through the transaction cap of the public blockchain network that may interfere with massive deployment [ 2]. 8.4 Regulatory Compliance It is difﬁcult to adhere to regulations, particularly the GDPR, because of the irreversibility of the account book. As a result, the system makes an effort to provide data storage and cryptoalgorithms in a way that fulﬁlls requests with only slight deletions [ 5]. 8.5 User Experience Technical users quickly adjusted to the system as a result of notice-based testing, but nontechnical users found it difﬁcult to utilize cryptographic keys. In an effort to increase their use in large circuits, they need more control units and improved interfaces [ 6]. 9 Conclusion Blockchain applications hosted in the cloud enhance digital ID management. They offer better user control, scalability, and security. This minimizes the risks involved with cen- tralized ID methods. Rules and scaling issues still exist. Nevertheless, mass adoption will evolve hybrid models, common standards, and code tricks. Future research should focus on improved privacy measures, blockchain modiﬁcations, and adherence to international ID standards. 686 S. Bafna et al.

Researchers evaluate mobile development trade-offs by analyzing Kotlin, Java and React Native through tests measuring three critical aspects which include performance and scalability in addition to developer productivity. Current research studies native frameworks and cross-platform development in separate analyses because developers need insights about their performance in identical development environments. The research ﬁlls this deﬁciency by integrating per- formance measurements of CPU utilization and memory allocations with survey- based insights and case study data. A direct evaluation of native Android pro- gramming languages (Kotlin and Java) with the popular cross-platform solution (React Native) stands as this research’s main contribution for performing thorough strength and weakness analysis.

The outcomes of this research support practitioners along with academics by providing clear understanding of mobile app development strategy trade-offs which enables better decisions and best practice establishment in the changing environment. Keywords: Kotlin · Java · React Native · cross-platform · performance 1 Introduction Mobile application development has evolved with the emergence of various program- ming languages and frameworks. Native development, primarily using Java and Kotlin, offers performance advantages, while cross-platform frameworks like React Native promise code reusability and faster development cycles. Despite numerous studies, there remains a lack of comprehensive empirical analyses comparing these technologies across multiple dimensions [ 1–5]. This research aims to ﬁll this gap by evaluating Kotlin, Java, and React Native concerning performance, scalability, and developer productivity. This comparison is especially signiﬁcant in today’s mobile app development con- text where project success often hinges on choosing a suitable framework. Decisions affect not only runtime performance and scalability but also cost, time-to-market, and maintenance overhead [6].

This study distinguishes itself from previous work by using a larger developer sample, testing on real devices with current framework versions, and integrating performance and developer experience metrics [ 8]. These methodological upgrades aim to provide stakeholders with actionable and contemporary insights [9, 10].

However, its verbosity and lack of modern features led to the adoption of Kotlin, which provides concise syntax, null safety, and full interoperability with Java [ 11, 12].

For instance, [ 16] analyzed API consumption in Java and Kotlin, while [17] compared Flutter and React Native. However, comprehensive analyses encompassing performance, scalability, and productivity are scarce. 2.4 Identiﬁed Gaps In addition, few prior studies [19–23] combine real-device benchmarking with developer- reported productivity and satisfaction data. By doing so, this work presents a more holistic evaluation that aligns with practical decision-making needs in commercial and academic settings. The literature lacks integrated studies that: 1) Compare Kotlin, Java, and React Native across multiple dimensions. 2) Utilize empirical data from public datasets. 3) Provide replicable methodologies for future research. 690 K.

Kotlin demonstrates the lowest CPU usage, both at idle and under load, reﬂecting its efﬁcient runtime behavior. React Native consumes the most CPU, especially under load, due to its JavaScript bridge overhead. Table 1. CPU Utilization (%).

Kotlin exhibits the most efﬁcient CPU usage across both scenarios, while React Native incurs signiﬁcantly higher usage during peak load, highlighting its runtime inefﬁciencies due to the JavaScript bridge. Table 2 shows memory allocation in megabytes for the three technologies during idle and peak usage. Kotlin again outperforms Java and React Native, with lower mem- ory usage across conditions.

Car networks are exposed to enormous vulnerabilities due to all the sensitive information exchanged between vehicles, the cloud, and other external sys- tems. These start from threats of unauthorized access to information, remote car hacking, and even mass cyberattacks on ﬂeets of vehicles.

With the car becoming increasingly sophisticated and networked, the security solutions that are currently fol- lowed become obsolete due to the ever-increasing complexities of the systems, and more advanced solutions must be implemented that can effectively address these attacks [ 1, 2]. 1.3 Role of AI Within Cybersecurity Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is also now an efﬁcient solution in cybersecurity as it can pro- vide the ability to detect, respond to, and defend against cyber attacks without any human intervention. AI systems can scan volumes of data, analyze trends, and predict possible security breaches in real time. As an offshoot branch of AI that entails independent initiative and decision-making, sub-agency AI is best suited to be used in cybersecurity applications for automotive systems attached to the cloud. Sub-agency AI, depending on artiﬁcial learning, anomaly detection, and threat analysis in real-time, possesses the ability to learn and react to new and unfamiliar threats on its own, providing the ability to provide dynamic security that is not feasible by any other security solution [ 3]. 1.4 Research Aim The prime focus of this research is to explore the application of agentic AI to enhance the security of cloud-connected vehicle systems.

Above all, it introduces the novel application of agentic AI, an independent and self-reliant AI system, to enhance connected vehicle security. Unlike traditional security Agentic AI-Driven Cybersecurity for Cloud-Connected Automotive Systems 699 systems based on pre-deﬁned rules and human intervention, agentic AI operates dynam- ically, detecting and thwarting cyber attacks in real-time with minimal human interven- tion. This research demonstrates the ability of agentic AI not only to react autonomously to emerging threats but also to learn and adapt to new, unforeseen vulnerabilities, and as such, is a highly effective solution to the constantly evolving nature of the cybersecurity threat landscape in the automotive industry. Secondly, the present research presents empirical data for the better performance of agentic AI compared to conventional cybersecurity tools, i.e., intrusion detection systems (IDS) and ﬁrewalls. The results reveal that agentic AI has a detection accuracy of 92%, a response time 40% less than the baseline, and a false-positive reduction of 35%, which reﬂects its efﬁcacy in countering possible cyber dangers.

Besides, the study contributes to developing AI-based security systems for motor cars by examining the application of machine learning, anomaly detection, and real- time threat analysis on connected vehicles. The work also establishes new avenues for future exploration of combining agentic AI with emerging technologies like 5G and edge computing, further enabling increased speed and efﬁciency in real-time threat detection and response. The work is ultimately the foundation for building the future of cybersecurity solutions intended to counter the connected car ecosystem’s increased complexity and dynamic nature. 2 Literature Review 2.1 Cybersecurity Challenges in Cloud-Connected Automotive Systems The more vehicles become cloud-connected using cloud-based solutions, the more sus- ceptible they are to sophisticated cyberattacks.

There is another risk from remote attacks, where attacks take over key car systems, including steering or brakes, by exploiting wireless communication channels. System manipulation is another threat, where cyber guys use their expertise to modify the car’s software or ﬁrmware, resulting in malfunction or unsafe driving. In 2015, hacking duo Charlie Miller and Chris V alasek took over a Jeep Cherokee miles away and unveiled the threatening risks of cloud-connected vehicles. The risks indicate the need for more cybersecurity defenses against intensiﬁed attacks [ 2, 3]. 2.2 AI in Cybersecurity Artiﬁcial intelligence-based technologies are increasingly at the center of cybersecurity across most industries, and the automotive industry is no exception. Deep learning and machine learning algorithms are particularly suited to identifying patterns and detecting anomalies from large databases.

Unlike traditional security solutions, agentic AI can evaluate threats, make decisions instantly, and take remedial actions independently of human inputs. Agentic AI can learn and react to new attacks instantly and with fewer pos- sibilities of cyberattacks. Agentic AI, within vehicle-to-cloud-integrated systems, can adjust security conﬁgurations autonomously, update defenses, and eliminate threats as and when they occur, signiﬁcantly enhancing the vehicle’s cyber resistance [ 4]. 2.4 Current Solutions and Limitations Traditional cybersecurity solutions such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), ﬁre- walls, and encryption have long been the cornerstone of protection methodologies in cloud-connected car systems. While these choices are foundational, they both possess insufﬁciencies that make them inadequate when protecting today’s dynamic automo- tive landscapes.

For instance, IDSs typically rely on recognizing attack patterns by interpreting trafﬁc patterns or system behavior and are therefore vulnerable to new or sophisticated attack techniques (Sathya & Ravi, 2021). Secondly, the effectiveness of IDS in dealing with volumes of real-time data generated by cloud-connected vehicles is limited since they are pre-rule and signature-based. These approaches may not respond promptly to new, complex threats, particularly concerning car systems, where response speed is critical to preventing potential security intrusions. While critical to blocking unauthorized access, ﬁrewalls are powerless against attacks from within the network, such as those exploiting system vulnerabilities or insider threats (Gautam et al., 2024). Moreover, ﬁrewalls in vehicle systems typically struggle with the high mobility and constant network change prevalent in connected cars. Encryption is another general mechanism to protect data transport between the cloud and the vehicle to preserve sensitive data while in transit. Encryption is applied to protect only data in transit and not against data attacks on embedded systems or vehicle software. For cars with cloud connectivity, an attacker who gains dominance of the vehicle’s software, via a breach of a vulnerable spot in a system, would bypass the encryption entirely, and it would be an insufﬁcient measure for overall cybersecurity (Zieni et al., 2025).

New advancements of these traditional solutions have incorporated enhancements, such as anomaly-based detection and implementation of machine learning in IDS (Stew- art et al., 2024). These techniques have improved the ability of IDS to identify unknown attacks by identifying suspicious patterns that do not conform to set norms. However, Agentic AI-Driven Cybersecurity for Cloud-Connected Automotive Systems 701 even such enhanced systems are still plagued by scalability and speed issues when deployed in cloud-connected vehicle systems, where data volume is enormous and con- tinuously changing. Further, while new machine learning-based models have been pro- posed for enhancing anomaly detection in vehicular networks, they are still highly reliant on static training data, which limits their ability to learn new threats autonomously in real-time (Punia et al., 2024). By contrast, the agentic AI model presented in this paper avoids these shortcomings by employing a fully autonomous AI system that can dynamically identify, analyze, and respond to emerging threats in real time without pre-conﬁguration or human intervention. Agentic AI operates by continuously learning from dynamic threats and interactions, enabling it to adapt to new attack vectors rapidly.

The test environment was conﬁgured to simulate everyday vehicle-to-cloud communication situations, both regular trafﬁc and attack scenarios, to test the effectiveness of how agentic AI would detect and respond to various cyber attacks in real time. There were also simulated attack data sets used to gauge the performance of agentic AI in test environments.

Detection accuracy would measure how effectively the AI can detect cyber attacks and respond correctly. Response time would measure how effectively the AI responds and nulliﬁes the threat.

To accomplish this, network trafﬁc with legitimate communication and a variety of simulated attack signatures, such as unauthorized access attempts, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, was fed to the Agentic AI.

The response time outcomes were quantiﬁed by measuring the time Agentic AI took to respond to a threat and trig- ger countermeasures such as isolating affected systems, blocking malicious trafﬁc, or alerting the user. The performance of a 40% faster response time compared to existing solutions was quantiﬁed in measurable performance by quantifying response times of the AI and comparing them against traditional security measures under the same test conditions.

Perhaps the most obvious are the resource issues, the sheer processing requirements for real-time information, and the high volume of threats. False positives, while mini- mized, are another problem, as they result in off-target alerts and the usage of resources. Scalability is another problem as automotive ﬂeets become more complex; AI must deal with larger data volumes and manage multiple vehicles simultaneously. However, these are areas as much as they are obstacles.

Traditional vehicle tracking methods, often reliant on clas- sical image processing or single-sensor approaches, struggle to deliver the accuracy and robustness required in complex, dynamic trafﬁc environments [ 2] . T h e r a p i d g r o w t h o f urbanization and the increasing number of vehicles on the road have created signiﬁcant challenges for trafﬁc management, road safety and ITS [3]. To address these challenges, real-time vehicle detection, tracking and distance estimation have become critical com- ponents of modern ITS solutions.

YOLO-based models have been widely adopted for vehicle detec- tion tasks due to their ability to perform real-time inference on edge devices and embed- ded platforms [5]. However, while object detection provides spatial localization in image coordinates, it lacks the ability to perceive the depth and three-dimensional position of objects. To overcome this limitation, stereo vision techniques are used to estimate depth by analyzing the disparity between image pairs captured by two horizontally displaced cameras. Stereo vision systems offer a passive, non-intrusive and cost-effective solu- tion for depth estimation in outdoor environments [ 6]. Traditional stereo camera setups are often constrained by ﬁxed hardware conﬁgurations, limiting their adaptability and scalability. In contrast, a customized stereo vision system built with two independent monocular cameras allows for adjustable baseline, resolution, and alignment parameters, providing greater ﬂexibility and accuracy for application-speciﬁc requirements [ 7]. V ehicle tracking systems (VTS) are fundamental components of ITS, supporting critical functions such as real-time trafﬁc monitoring, driver assistance systems and security applications. Studies in the literature generally fall into three main categories: traditional model-based approaches [ 8], classical computer vision-based methods [ 9], and recent deep learning-based approaches [ 10].

However, these methods struggle with sudden changes in motion, occlusions and noisy backgrounds. Classical computer vision-based methods have used hand-crafted features and classiﬁers such as histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and support vector machines (SVM) [ 14], Haar cascades [ 15], optical ﬂow [ 16] and deformable part models (DPM).

In vehicle tracking algorithms, tracking methods such as DeepSORT and ByteTrack have been used in combination with YOLO to increase tracking accuracy [19]. However, these methods also suffer from tracking errors and identity confusion, espe- cially in heavy trafﬁc environments and when vehicles are close together. While these methods are robust to occlusion and appearance changes, they lack depth perception, making them less effective at estimating distances between objects - a key requirement for trafﬁc analysis and autonomous driving. While previous studies have made signiﬁcant progress in the areas of vehicle detec- tion, tracking and distance estimation, there are some fundamental limitations and oppor- tunities for improvement. Distance estimation methods based on stereo vision offer sig- niﬁcant advantages in vehicle positioning by providing depth information. However, stereo image processing can be complex and computationally expensive. In addition, stereo vision systems are affected by environmental factors such as lighting conditions, weather and camera calibration, which limit the overall reliability of the system [ 20].

The cameras are conﬁgured to operate at a resolution of 1280 × 720 pixels and 30 frames per second. This resolution provides sufﬁcient computational efﬁciency for real-time processing while maintaining a sufﬁ- cient level of detail for vehicle detection and depth estimation. The cameras are mounted in the horizontal plane with a base spacing of approximately 13 cm. This distance was experimentally determined to ensure accurate measurement of object (vehicle) distances in the range of 2 to 10 m, which is commonly observed in urban trafﬁc scenarios. On the other hand, the cameras were ﬁxed to the platform and the optical axes were kept as parallel to each other as possible. This ensured minimal geometric deviation between the matched images after stereo rectiﬁcation.

The predictions obtained by the ﬁlter are updated with minimum error, taking into account measurement noise and uncertainties in the system. In this respect, the Kalman ﬁlter is widely preferred, especially in applications requiring real- time position tracking and motion estimation [ 27]. Depth data (distance information) from stereo camera systems can be noisy or inac- curate, especially on low-texture surfaces, glass reﬂections or sudden changes in light. In such cases, direct measurements may cause sudden jumps in vehicle position tracking, loss of accuracy and visual distortion. To solve this problem, in this study, a separate Kalman ﬁlter for each vehicle is deﬁned and the measurement data is made more stable over time. In our work, the Kalman ﬁlter is used to consistently track the identities of vehicles detected by YOLOv8 in each frame and to estimate the next position of moving objects.

The Lucas-Kanade method is a gradient-based and local windowing approach proposed to solve this problem [ 29]. This method deﬁnes small windows around certain feature points in the image and calculates motion vectors based on the brightness changes in these windows. The Lucas-Kanade algorithm is a widely used differential method for estimating optical ﬂow, which represents the apparent motion of brightness patterns in an image sequence. The algorithm is particularly effective for tracking features in video sequences due to its computational efﬁciency and robustness to noise [ 30]. The method is based on the brightness constancy assumption, which states that the intensity of a moving object remains constant between successive frames. The algorithm assumes a small neighborhood around each pixel where the motion (optical ﬂow vector) is consistent, and solves for this motion using a least squares approximation.

After the calibration process, stereo rectiﬁcation was applied in the OpenCV environment. In rectiﬁcation, the stereo images are aligned with the Epipolar lines and each pixel is corrected to show a shift only in the horizontal axis, optimizing the matching process. 718 E. Dandıle ta l .

The disparity values are used to calculate the real-world depth for each pixel. In this study, the left and right camera images were aligned to the epipolar lines and made suitable for generating disparity maps using the StereoSGBM algorithm.

The YOLOv8 model was Real-Time V ehicle Tracking System 719 adapted by applying transfer learning to pre-trained weights provided by Ultralytics. The vehicle detection training process was performed using the Road V ehicle Images dataset [34]. This dataset contains vehicle images acquired from different camera angles and environmental conditions (day/night, rainy/clear weather). During transfer learning, only the last layers of the model were retrained, using classes such as ‘car’, ‘bus’, ‘truck’, ‘taxi’, ‘van’, ‘pickup’, ‘police car’, ‘suv’. In this way, high accuracy vehicle detection was achieved with limited data. V ehicle detection in a real-time video using YOLOv8 is realized as shown in Fig. 7. The center points of the bounding boxes of the vehicles detected by the YOLOv8 model in each frame of the videos were analyzed on the simultaneously generated stereo depth map.

However, stereo matching algorithms may not inherently produce a reliable dispar- ity in all pixels. Therefore, instead of relying directly on the disparity value of a single pixel, a region of interest (RoI) near the center of the box was deﬁned and the values in this region were evaluated. First, the average of all disparity values within the RoI was calculated, and the median of the values above this average was taken to provide a more robust estimate. In addition, extreme outliers (very small or very large disparity values) were removed and a reﬁned disparity value was obtained. This reduces the inﬂuence of individual noisy pixels on the overall measurement. The resulting reliable disparity value was converted to real units using stereo distance conversion. Fig. 7.

However, depth (distance) data from stereo camera systems can be noisy or inaccurate, especially on low-texture surfaces, glass reﬂections or sudden changes in light. In such cases, direct measurements can lead to sudden jumps in vehicle position tracking, loss of accuracy and visual distortion. To overcome this problem, this project deﬁnes a separate Kalman ﬁlter for each vehicle and makes the measurement data more stable over time. The Lucas-Kanade optical ﬂow algorithm is used in this study to estimate the direc- tion of movement of vehicles in the horizontal plane. While YOLOv8 handles real-time object detection in each frame, it does not inherently track motion across consecutive frames. The Lucas-Kanade algorithm complements this by estimating the displacement of detected vehicles between frames based on the change in pixel intensities over time. In our system, features within the detected vehicle regions are selected and their motion is tracked using the pyramidal implementation of the Lucas-Kanade algorithm, which improves accuracy for larger displacements by operating at multiple image scales. The Lucas-Kanade tracker outputs are then fused with the Kalman ﬁlter predictions to ensure both spatial and temporal continuity in the vehicle trajectories.

Accordingly, the horizontal positions of the vehicles in each frame and the distance between them and the camera are visualized on a top-down map, making the system outputs more understandable and interpretable. The object IDs of the vehicles detected by the YOLOv8 algorithm in each frame are based on their depth values stabilized by the Kalman ﬁlter, and their position deviations in the x-direction. The horizontal center coordinate of each detection box and its real x-axis position were calculated using the Kalman ﬁltered depth estimate.

Each point is labelled with an object ID and current distance value for added clariﬁcation.

For exper- imental validation, distance measurements were taken at predeﬁned intervals of 1 m, 2 m, 3 m, 4 m, 5 m and 6 m. The ﬁgure compares the actual (ground truth) distances with those measured by the system’s integrated stereo vision-based estimation module. The results show that the accuracy of the distance estimation improves signiﬁcantly as the object moves away from the camera. At closer distances - such as 1 m and 2 m - the mea- sured distances were 0.75 m and 2.08 m respectively, reﬂecting small underestimations and overestimations due to disparity errors and baseline calibration limitations inherent in stereo vision systems at near-ﬁeld depths. In contrast, at longer distances (4–6 m), the measured values (4.48 m, 5.09 m and 6.23 m) show greater consistency and mini- mal deviation from actual distances, indicating better depth triangulation performance in mid-to-far scenes. This performance trend is consistent with typical stereo vision behavior, where depth estimation error is inversely correlated with the square of the disparity value.

The system successfully performed detection, tracking, distance estimation and trajectory mapping of moving vehicles in real-world scenarios.

The use of stereo vision provided an additional depth layer, enabling the sys- tem not only to detect vehicles, but also to estimate their real-world distances from the camera system. The implementation of Lucas-Kanade optical ﬂow and Kalman ﬁlters for motion tracking and trajectory estimation further improved temporal consistency, allowing smooth and reliable tracking of moving vehicles across successive frames. In addition, the generation of a top-down trajectory map in 2D space based on stereo disparity has provided valuable insights into vehicle movement patterns and supports advanced trafﬁc behavior analysis. Experimental evaluations using different frame sequences and ground truth distances demonstrated the system’s ability to estimate vehicle distances with low MAE and MSE, particularly in the 2–5 m range. While the accuracy of the distance estimation degraded slightly at very close (1 m) and distant (6 m) ranges, the overall robustness of the system remained high. These deviations can be attributed to limitations in disparity precision at the limits of stereo vision and are considered acceptable in the context of real-time applications.

Secondly, the use of a ﬁxed stereo baseline limits the accuracy of depth esti- mation at long distances. In addition, the system was evaluated under controlled lighting and weather conditions; performance under adverse conditions needs to be validated. To further improve the performance and applicability of the proposed system, we plan to implement a variable baseline stereo camera system to improve depth estimation accu- racy at both near and far distances, and to incorporate multi-class vehicle tracking and pedestrian detection for a more comprehensive understanding of the trafﬁc scene.
